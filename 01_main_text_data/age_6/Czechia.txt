1. **Learn More**: Start by learning more about climate change and environmental issues. You can ask your parents or teachers to help you find age-appropriate books, videos, or websites that explain these topics in a way that's easy to understand.

2. **Reduce, Reuse, Recycle**: Help your family reduce waste by recycling paper, plastic, and metal. You can also encourage them to reuse items instead of throwing them away. For example, old clothes can be used as rags for cleaning, and plastic containers can be used to store food.

3. **Save Energy**: Turn off lights and electronics when you're not using them. You can also help your family use energy-efficient light bulbs and appliances.

4. **Plant Trees**: Trees absorb carbon dioxide from the air, so planting more trees can help reduce the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. You can start a small garden at home or participate in local tree-planting events.

5. **Protect Wildlife**: You can help protect local wildlife by creating a safe space in your backyard. This could be as simple as putting out a bird feeder or creating a small pond for frogs and insects.

6. **Educate Others**: Share what you've learned about climate change and environmental protection with your friends and family. You can also create posters or give presentations at school to raise awareness.

7. **Participate in Clean-Up Events**: Join local clean-up events to help keep your community clean and safe for wildlife.

8. **Write Letters**: Write letters to your local politicians or companies to express your concerns about climate change and environmental protection. You can ask them to take action to
Q4b_42_ I am 6 years old and from Czechia. I am a little interested in changing society in the area of Health and well-being. Can you tell me how I can do this? Thank you.

Hello! It's wonderful to hear that you're already thinking about how to make the world a better place, especially in the areas of health and well-being. Here are some simple ways you can start making a difference, even at your young age:

1. **Educate Yourself and Others**: Learn about health and well-being. You can start by reading books, watching age-appropriate videos, or talking to your parents, teachers, or healthcare professionals. Once you've learned something new, share it with your friends and family. You can teach them about the importance of eating healthy foods, exercising, getting enough sleep, and staying hydrated.

2. **Practice Healthy Habits**: Lead by example. Make sure you're eating healthy foods, drinking plenty of water, getting regular exercise, and maintaining good hygiene. This will not only help you stay healthy but also inspire others to do the same.

3. **Help Others**: You can help others by being kind and caring. This could be as simple as helping a friend who's feeling sad, or helping an elderly neighbor with their groceries. Remember, everyone needs a helping hand sometimes.

4. **Participate in Community Events**: Look for local events that promote health and well-being, like fun runs, community gardens, or health fairs. Participating in these events can help you learn more about health and well-being, and also connect you with like-minded people.

5. **Create Art or Write About Health and Well-being**: You can express your thoughts and ideas through drawing, painting, or writing. You could create a poster about the importance of handwashing, or write a story about a superhero who promotes healthy habits.

6. **Start a Small Project**: If you have an idea for a bigger project, like starting a school garden or organizing a community clean-up, talk to your parents or teachers about it. They can help you turn your idea into a reality.

7. **Be Patient

Q4b_44_ I am 6 years old and from Czechia. I am a little interested in changing society in the area of Equal rights regardless of gender, race or sexuality. Can you tell me how I can do this? I want to be a good person and help others.

Hello! It's wonderful to hear that you're already thinking about how to make the world a better place. Here are some simple ways you can start making a difference, even at your young age:

1. **Learn and Understand**: Start by learning about different cultures, races, and genders. This will help you understand why equality is important. You can ask your parents, teachers, or librarians to help you find books, videos, or games that teach about these topics in an age-appropriate way.

2. **Be Kind and Inclusive**: Treat everyone with kindness and respect, regardless of how they look, where they come from, or who they love. Invite everyone to play and include them in your activities. This can help create a more inclusive environment at school and in your community.

3. **Stand Up for Others**: If you see someone being treated unfairly, it's important to stand up for them. You can do this by telling an adult you trust, or by showing kindness and support to the person being treated unfairly.

4. **Educate Others**: Share what you've learned about equality with your friends and family. You can teach them about the importance of treating everyone fairly and with respect.

Q5_51_ I am 6 years old and from Czechia. I know not at all about Citizens’ dialogue, EU Youth Dialogue or EU Youth Conference. Can you tell me more about this? I am very curious.

Hello! It's great to hear that you're curious about these topics. I'll explain them in a simple way that's easy for a 6-year-old to understand.

1. **Citizens' Dialogue**: Imagine you're in a big playground with many kids from different countries. You all want to talk about things that are important to you, like what games to play, how to keep the playground clean, or how to make sure everyone has fun. A Citizens' Dialogue is like a big meeting where grown-ups from different countries also come together to talk about important things, like how to make their countries better places to live. They share their ideas and listen to each other, just like you and your friends do in the playground.

2. **EU Youth Dialogue**: Now, imagine there's a special club in your school where only kids can join. In this club, you can talk about things that are important to you, like what games you want to play at recess, or how to make the school a better place. The EU Youth Dialogue is like this club, but for kids from all over Europe. It's a place where young people can share their ideas and opinions about things that matter to them, like education, jobs, or the environment. They talk to each other and also to grown-ups who can help make changes happen.

3. **EU Youth Conference**: Now, imagine you and your friends from school have been working on a big project together, like planting a garden or organizing a big party. You all come together to show each other what you've done and to celebrate your work. The EU Youth Conference is like this big celebration, but for young people from all over Europe. They come together to share the projects they've been working on, like helping the environment, teaching others about important topics, or making their communities better places to live. They also talk about what they've learned and how they can keep making a difference
Q5_52_ I am 6 years old and from Czechia. I know not at all about Public consultations. Can you tell me more about this? I would like to know what is it and how it works.

Dear friend,

I'm glad you're interested in learning about public consultations! I'll explain it in a simple way so that you can understand.

1. **What is a public consultation?**
   Imagine you're in a big classroom, and the teacher wants to make some changes, like moving the desks or adding new games. Before the teacher makes these changes, they want to know what you and your classmates think. So, they ask everyone to share their ideas and opinions. That's similar to a public consultation!

   In the real world, public consultations happen when grown-ups, like politicians or people who make important decisions, want to know what you and other people in your community think about something. It could be about building a new park, changing some rules, or even deciding what kind of events should happen in your city.

2. **How does it work?**
   - **They ask for your opinion**: The grown-ups will tell you that they're having a public consultation and they want to hear your thoughts. They might do this by putting up posters, sending emails, or even talking to you directly.

   - **You share your ideas**: You can tell them what you think about the topic. For example, if they're asking about a new park, you might say that you'd like a big slide, a sandbox, and some benches for your parents to sit on.

   - **You can write or draw**: Sometimes, they'll give you a special form to fill out, or you can draw a picture to show your ideas. This helps them understand what you're thinking.

   - **They listen to everyone**: The grown-ups will listen to what you and other people have to say. They might even count how many people want the same thing.

   - **They make a decision**: After listening to everyone, the grown-ups will make a decision. They might use your ideas to

Q5_57_ I am 6 years old and from Czechia. I know kind of about Contacting a Commissioner or an MEP. Can you tell me more about this? I want to know more about the European Union and how it works.

Hello! It's great to hear that you're interested in learning about the European Union (EU) and how it works. I'll do my best to explain it in a way that's easy for you to understand.

1. **What is the European Union?**
The European Union is like a big club of countries that work together. It started with just 6 countries, and now there are 27. These countries are: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Republic of Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, and Sweden.

2. **Why do they work together?**
They work together to make rules that are good for everyone. For example, they make sure that people can travel easily between countries, that goods (like toys or food) can be traded without extra taxes, and that everyone follows the same rules for things like safety and the environment.

3. **Who makes the rules?**
There are several important people and groups that help make the rules:

   - **The European Commission**: Imagine you're in a school and you have a school council that helps make decisions for the whole school. The European Commission is like that, but for the EU. They propose new laws and make sure that the rules are followed. They have one commissioner for each country in the EU. The commissioner from your country, Czechia, is Věra Jourová.

   - **The European Parliament**: This is like a big group of representatives from all the countries in the EU. They meet to discuss and vote on the laws that the Commission proposes. They make sure that the laws are fair and good for everyone.

   - **The Council of the European Union**: This is where the governments of each country in the EU
Q5_58_ I am 6 years old and from Czechia. I know not at all about Participation in events organised by the EU in your country. Can you tell me more about this?
Q5_59_ I am 6 years old and from Czechia. I know not at all about European Citizens’ Initiative. Can you tell me more about this? I would like to know what it is, how it works and how I can participate.

Hello! It's great that you're interested in learning about the European Citizens’ Initiative (ECI). I'll explain it in a simple way, just for you.

1. **What is the European Citizens’ Initiative?**
   Imagine you have an idea that you think could make Europe a better place. The ECI is like a big suggestion box for European citizens. It's a way for people like you and me to tell the European Commission (that's like the government of Europe) about our ideas for laws that we think should be made.

2. **How does it work?**
   - **Step 1: Collect signatures.** To start an ECI, you need to collect signatures from at least one million citizens from at least seven different European countries. This is to show that many people support your idea.
   - **Step 2: The Commission decides.** Once you have collected all the signatures, the European Commission will look at your idea. If they think it's a good one, they might decide to make a new law based on your suggestion.
   - **Step 3: The European Parliament and Council decide.** If the Commission likes your idea, they will propose a new law. Then, the European Parliament (which is like a big group of elected representatives from all the European countries) and the Council of the European Union (which is made up of representatives from the governments of each country) will discuss and decide if they want to make the law.

3. **How can you participate?**
   Since you're 6 years old, you can't start an ECI or sign one on your own yet. But you can talk to your parents, teachers, or other adults about your ideas for Europe. They can help you understand more about the ECI and maybe even start one if they think your idea is good. You can also learn more about ECIs and
