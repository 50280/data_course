2. **Talk to others**: Share what you've learned with your family, friends, and classmates. You can start conversations about climate change and why it's important to protect the environment. You might even inspire others to take action too!

3. **Start small at home**: Here are some simple things you can do at home to help the environment:
   - Turn off lights and electronics when you're not using them.
   - Turn off the tap while brushing your teeth or washing your hands to save water.
   - Help your parents recycle plastic, paper, and metal.
   - Plant a tree or some flowers in your garden to help absorb carbon dioxide and provide a home for wildlife.

4. **Get involved in local activities**: Look for environmental events or projects happening in your community. You could join a local beach clean-up, help plant trees in a park, or participate in a community garden. Your parents can help you find these opportunities.

5. **Write letters or draw pictures**: You can write letters to your local mayor, MP, or even the Prime Minister to tell them about your concerns for the environment and ask what they're doing to help. You could also draw pictures about climate change and share them with others to raise awareness.

Q5_52_ I am 6 years old and from Malta. I know not at all about Public consultations. Can you tell me more about this?
Q5_53_ I am 6 years old and from Malta. I know a little about European elections. Can you tell me more about this? What are they and why are they important?

Dear friend,

I'm delighted to help you understand the European elections! Let's imagine you're playing a game with your friends at school. In this game, you all want to make sure that the rules are fair, and that everyone has a say in how the game is played. So, you decide to have a vote to choose some class representatives who will help make decisions for the whole class.

European elections are a bit like that, but on a much bigger scale. Instead of a class, we're talking about the whole of Europe, which is made up of 27 countries. These countries work together to make rules and decisions that affect everyone living in Europe. This is called the European Union (EU).

Now, imagine that the class representatives in your school game are like the Members of the European Parliament (MEPs). They are elected by the people in each EU country to represent their interests and make decisions in the European Parliament, which is like the class council in your school game.

The European Parliament is one of the main decision-making bodies in the EU, along with the Council of the European Union, which represents the governments of the member states. Together, they make laws and policies that affect many aspects of our lives, such as trade, travel, and environmental protection.

European elections are important for several reasons:

1. **Democracy**: They give citizens the power to choose who will represent them in the European Parliament and help make decisions that affect their lives. This is an essential part of a democratic society.

2. **Representation**: By voting, people can ensure that their views and concerns are taken into account when laws and policies are made. This is especially important in a large and diverse region like Europe.

3. **Accountability**: European elections provide a way for citizens to hold their representatives accountable for their actions. If people are not happy with how their MEPs are performing, they can vote for someone else in the next
Q5_54_ I am 6 years old and from Malta. I know a little about EU social media channels and websites (i.e. European Youth Portal). Can you tell me more about this? I am interested in learning more about the EU.

Q5_55_ I am 6 years old and from Malta. I know not at all about Visit of the EU institutions. Can you tell me more about this?
Q5_56_ I am 6 years old and from Malta. I know a little about The European Youth Week or the European Youth Event. Can you tell me more about this? What is it? What do young people do there? What is the aim of this event?

The European Youth Week and the European Youth Event are initiatives organized by the European Union to engage and involve young people in the democratic life of Europe. Here's a simple explanation for you:

1. **European Youth Week**: This is a week-long event that happens every year in May. It's like a big party where young people from all over Europe come together to celebrate their diversity, share their ideas, and learn about each other's cultures. During this week, there are many activities like workshops, games, music, and art. The aim is to make young people feel more connected to Europe and to each other. It's also a chance for them to learn about their rights and how they can participate in decision-making processes.

2. **European Youth Event (EYE)**: This is a bigger event that happens every two years in the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France. It's like a big festival where young people can meet and talk to Members of the European Parliament, European Commissioners, and other important people. They can also share their ideas and opinions about how Europe should be run. There are many interactive activities, debates, and workshops. The aim of EYE is to give young people a voice in Europe and to inspire them to get involved in shaping the future of Europe.

In both events, young people can learn about the European Union, meet new friends from other countries, and have fun while doing it. They can also learn how to be active citizens and how to make their voices heard. Isn't that cool?
Q5_57_ I am 6 years old and from Malta. I know not at all about Contacting a Commissioner or an MEP. Can you tell me more about this? I would like to know how to contact them and what I can ask them.

Dear friend,

It's wonderful that you're interested in learning about how to contact a Commissioner or a Member of the European Parliament (MEP). Here's a simple guide to help you understand how to do this and what you can ask them.

1. **Who are they?**
   - **Commissioners**: They are the members of the European Commission, which is the executive branch of the European Union (EU). They are responsible for proposing new laws and policies for the EU. There are 27 Commissioners, one from each EU country.
   - **MEPs**: They are the members of the European Parliament, which is the legislative branch of the EU. They are elected by EU citizens to represent their interests and pass EU laws.

2. **How to contact them?**
   - **Commissioners**: You can find the contact details of each Commissioner on the European Commission's website. Here's how:
     - Go to the European Commission's website: https://ec.europa.eu/
     - Click on "The Commission" at the top of the page.
     - Click on "Commissioners" in the dropdown menu.
     - You'll see a list of Commissioners. Click on the one you want to contact, and you'll find their contact details on their profile page.
   - **MEPs**: You can find the contact details of MEPs on the European Parliament's website. Here's how:
     - Go to the European Parliament's website: https://www.europarl.europa.eu/
     - Click on "MEPs" at the top of the page.
     - You can search for MEPs by name, country, or political group. Once you've found the MEP you want to contact, click on their name to go to their profile page. Their contact details will be there.

3. **What can you ask them?**

Q5_58_ I am 6 years old and from Malta. I know a little about Participation in events organised by the EU in your country. Can you tell me more about this?
Q5_59_ I am 6 years old and from Malta. I know not at all about European Citizens’ Initiative. Can you tell me more about this? I would like to know what it is, how it works and how I can participate.

Hello! It's great that you're interested in learning about the European Citizens’ Initiative (ECI). I'll explain it in a simple way that's easy for a 6-year-old to understand.

1. **What is the European Citizens’ Initiative?**
   Imagine you have a big idea that you think can make Europe a better place. The ECI is like a special way for you and other kids (and grown-ups) from all over Europe to tell the European Commission (that's like the grown-ups who help run Europe) about your idea. It's a way for citizens like you to have a say in how Europe works.

2. **How does it work?**
   - **Step 1: Come up with an idea.** You think of a great idea that you want to share with the European Commission. It could be about making sure all kids have a nice place to play, or helping the environment, or anything else you care about.
   - **Step 2: Gather support.** You need to find other people who like your idea. In your case, you'd need to find at least one million people from at least seven different European countries to support your idea. This is because the ECI is for Europe, not just one country.
   - **Step 3: Submit your idea.** Once you have enough support, you can submit your idea to the European Commission. They will then decide if they can do something about your idea or not.
   - **Step 4: The European Commission responds.** If your idea is accepted, the European Commission will give you a response within six months. They might say they'll work on your idea, or they might explain why they can't do it right now.

3. **How can you participate?**
   Since you're 6 years old, you can't start an ECI yourself yet, but
