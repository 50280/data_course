Hello! It's wonderful to hear that you're already thinking about how to make the world a healthier and happier place. Here are some simple ways you can start making a difference at your age:

1. **Educate Yourself**: Learn about health and well-being. You can ask your parents or teachers to help you find books, videos, or websites that explain these topics in a way that's easy for kids to understand.

2. **Share What You Learn**: Once you've learned something new, share it with others. You can tell your friends, family, or even create a simple poster to hang up at home or school.

3. **Encourage Physical Activity**: Make sure you're getting enough exercise. This could be playing outside, dancing, or doing yoga. You can also encourage your friends to join you.

4. **Eat Healthy**: Try to eat more fruits and vegetables. You can help with cooking or preparing snacks at home. Remember, it's okay to not like every healthy food, but it's important to keep trying.

5. **Practice Good Hygiene**: This includes washing your hands regularly, brushing your teeth, and taking baths or showers. You can remind your friends to do the same.

6. **Be Kind and Help Others**: This is a big part of well-being. You can help by sharing your toys, helping with chores, or being kind to others.

7. **Take Care of Your Emotional Health**: This means managing your feelings in a healthy way. If you're feeling sad or angry, it's okay to talk about it with someone you trust.

8. **Start a Club or Group**: If you're really passionate about this, you could start a club at school or in your community where you and your friends can learn and share more about health and well-being.

9. **Write to Your Local Leaders**: You can write letters or draw pictures
Q4b_43_ I am 6 years old and from Austria. I am a little interested in changing society in the area of Economic inequality and welfare expenditure. Can you tell me how I can do this? I want to do something good for the world.

Hello! It's wonderful to hear that you're already thinking about how to make the world a better place. Here are some age-appropriate ways you can start making a difference:

1. **Learn and Understand**: Start by learning more about economic inequality and welfare expenditure. You can ask your parents, teachers, or librarians to help you find books, videos, or websites that explain these topics in a way that's easy for kids to understand.

2. **Talk About It**: Discuss what you've learned with your family, friends, and classmates. You can share what you know and ask them what they think. This can help spread awareness and understanding.

3. **Help Others**: You can start by helping people in your own community. Here are a few ideas:
   - **Volunteer**: Look for local charities or organizations that help people in need. You might be able to volunteer with your family. This could be anything from helping at a food bank, to visiting elderly neighbors, or cleaning up a local park.
   - **Fundraise**: You could organize a small fundraiser, like a lemonade stand or a bake sale, and donate the money to a charity that helps people in need.
   - **Donate**: If you have toys or clothes you no longer use, you could donate them to a charity shop. This can help other children who might not have as much as you.

4. **Write Letters**: You could write letters to local politicians or leaders to share your thoughts about economic inequality and welfare expenditure. They might not be able to reply, but it's important for them to know that even kids care about these issues.

5. **Plant a Garden**: Growing your own fruits and vegetables can help you understand where food comes from and how important it is for everyone to have access to healthy food. You could even donate some of your harvest to a local food bank.

Q4b_46_ I am 6 years old and from Austria. I am a little interested in changing society in the area of Wars and conflicts. Can you tell me how I can do this? I want to be a peacekeeper.

Dear friend,

It's wonderful to hear that you're already thinking about how to make the world a more peaceful place! Here are some steps you can take, even at your young age:

1. **Learn about Peace**: Start by learning more about peace, why it's important, and what causes conflicts. You can ask your parents, teachers, or librarians to help you find books, videos, or games that talk about these topics in a way that's easy for kids to understand.

2. **Share Your Knowledge**: Once you've learned about peace, share what you've learned with your friends, family, and classmates. You can do this by talking about it, drawing pictures, or even writing a story.

3. **Be Kind and Respectful**: Treat others with kindness and respect. This is a big part of creating peace. You can start by being nice to your friends, family, and even people you don't know very well.

4. **Stand Up for Others**: If you see someone being treated unfairly, try to help them. This could be as simple as standing up for a classmate who's being left out, or telling an adult if you see someone being hurt.

5. **Participate in Peaceful Activities**: Join or start activities that promote peace. This could be a peace club at your school, a community service project, or even a game of soccer with your friends.

6. **Write to Leaders**: When you're older, you can write letters to your local leaders, or even the President or Prime Minister, to tell them about your ideas for creating peace.

7. **Educate Yourself**: Keep learning about the world. The more you know, the better you'll understand how to make a difference.

8. **Be Patient**: Making the world a more peaceful place takes time. Don't get discouraged if you don't see changes right away. Keep trying, and remember that
Q4b_47_ I am 6 years old and from Austria. I am a little interested in changing society in the area of Democracy and rule of law. Can you tell me how I can do this? I want to be a lawyer when I grow up.

Dear young friend,

It's wonderful to hear about your interest in making a positive change in society, especially at such a young age! Here are some steps you can take to start your journey towards becoming a lawyer and promoting democracy and the rule of law:

1. **Educate Yourself**: Start by learning more about democracy, rule of law, and human rights. Read books, watch documentaries, and talk to your parents, teachers, and other adults about these topics. Some children's books that touch on these subjects include "The Little Book of Big Ideas" by Susan Hood and "The Story of an Idea: A Book About the Rule of Law" by Katherena Vermette.

2. **Understand Your Rights**: Learn about your rights as a child and as a citizen. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights are great places to start. Understanding your rights will help you appreciate the importance of the rule of law and democracy.

3. **Participate in School Activities**: Join school clubs or activities that focus on social issues, human rights, or democracy. If there aren't any, consider starting your own club. This will help you meet like-minded peers and learn more about these topics.

4. **Engage in Community Service**: Participate in community service projects that align with your interests. This could be anything from helping at a local animal shelter to organizing a community clean-up. These experiences will not only help you understand the needs of your community but also develop important skills like empathy, teamwork, and leadership.

5. **Learn About Law**: Start learning about the law. You can do this by reading books, watching movies, or even playing games that involve law and justice. Some children's books about law include "The Trial" by Jim Eldridge and "The Great Kapok Tree" by Lynne Cherry.

6. **Role-Play**: Eng
Q5_51_ I am 6 years old and from Austria. I know not at all about Citizens’ dialogue, EU Youth Dialogue or EU Youth Conference. Can you tell me more about this? I am very curious.

Dear friend,

I'm glad you're curious about these topics! Let's imagine you're in a big playground called Europe, where many children from different countries come to play together. This playground has some special rules and activities that make it fun for everyone.

1. **Citizens' Dialogue**: Imagine you're playing with your friends, and sometimes you have disagreements about how to play a game or share toys. To solve these issues, you all sit down and talk about your ideas and feelings. You listen to each other and try to find a solution that makes everyone happy. That's similar to a Citizens' Dialogue. In this case, grown-ups from different European countries get together to talk about important topics, like how to make the playground (Europe) a better place for everyone. They share their ideas and listen to each other, just like you and your friends do when you play together.

2. **EU Youth Dialogue**: Now, imagine there's a special club in the playground where only children can join. In this club, you can talk about things that are important to you, like how to make the playground more fun, or how to help other children who might be feeling left out. The grown-ups listen to what you have to say and try to help you make changes for the better. That's what the EU Youth Dialogue is like. It's a way for young people from all over Europe to come together, share their ideas, and talk about how to make Europe a better place for young people like you.

3. **EU Youth Conference**: Finally, imagine that once a year, the playground organizes a big party where all the children can come together, play games, and share their experiences. At this party, you can also talk about the things you've been working on in the special club (EU Youth Dialogue) and show everyone what you've achieved. That's what the EU Youth Conference is like. It's a
Q5_52_ I am 6 years old and from Austria. I know not at all about Public consultations. Can you tell me more about this? I am very curious.

Hello! It's wonderful to hear that you're curious about public consultations. I'll explain it in a simple way so that you can understand.

A public consultation is like a big conversation between people and the people who make rules and decisions for a city, country, or even the whole world. It's a way for everyone to have a say in what happens in their community or the world.

Imagine you're in a classroom, and the teacher wants to decide on a new game for recess. The teacher could just pick a game on their own, but that might not be fair because some kids might not like that game. So, the teacher asks everyone in the class what games they like, and then they all talk about it together. That's a bit like a public consultation!

In a public consultation, grown-ups who make decisions (like politicians, or people who work for the government) ask everyone in the community what they think about a certain topic. They might want to know if people like or dislike an idea, or if they have any good suggestions to make things better.

For example, let's say the city wants to build a new playground. They might have a public consultation to ask people:

1. Where they think the playground should be built.
2. What kind of equipment they want in the playground.
3. If they have any ideas to make the playground fun and safe for everyone.

People can share their thoughts by filling out a form, talking to the people who are organizing the consultation, or even drawing pictures if they're too young to write. This way, everyone's voice is heard, and the city can make a decision that most people will be happy with.

So, public consultations are like big, important conversations that help make sure everyone has a say in the things that affect their lives. It's a great way for people to work together and make their community a better place!
Q5_53_ I am 6 years old and from Austria. I know kind of about European elections. Can you tell me more about this? What are they and why are they important?

Dear friend,

I'm delighted to help you understand the European elections! Let's imagine you're playing a game with your friends at school. In this game, you all want to make sure that the rules are fair, and that everyone has a say in how the game is played. So, you decide to have a vote to choose some class representatives who will help make decisions and ensure everyone's voice is heard.

European elections are a bit like that, but on a much larger scale, involving the countries of the European Union (EU). The EU is like a big club of 27 countries that work together to make rules and decisions that affect their citizens. These countries are:

1. Austria (where you live!)
2. Belgium
3. Bulgaria
4. Croatia
5. Republic of Cyprus
6. Czech Republic
7. Denmark
8. Estonia
9. Finland
10. France
11. Germany
12. Greece
13. Hungary
14. Ireland
15. Italy
16. Latvia
17. Lithuania
18. Luxembourg
19. Malta
20. Netherlands
21. Poland
22. Portugal
23. Romania
24. Slovakia
25. Slovenia
26. Spain
27. Sweden

Now, just like in your school game, the European Union needs people to represent the citizens and help make decisions. These representatives are called Members of the European Parliament (MEPs). They are elected by the people of each EU country every five years, in what we call the European elections.

Here's why these elections are important:

1. **Choosing who represents you**: By voting or having your voice heard through the election process, you help choose the people who will represent your country and its values in the European Parliament. This means they will work to make sure your voice is heard when important decisions are

Q5_59_ I am 6 years old and from Austria. I know a little about European Citizens’ Initiative. Can you tell me more about this? What is it?

Hello! It's great to hear that you're interested in learning about the European Citizens’ Initiative (ECI). I'll do my best to explain it in a simple way.

The European Citizens’ Initiative is a way for citizens of the European Union (EU) to ask the European Commission, which is like the government of the EU, to propose new laws. This means that if a large group of EU citizens come together and have an idea for a new law that they think would be good for Europe, they can start an ECI to try and make it happen.

Here's how it works:

1. **Collecting signatures**: To start an ECI, a group of citizens needs to collect signatures from at least one million EU citizens from at least seven different EU countries. This shows that many people support the idea for a new law.

2. **Checking the signatures**: The signatures are then checked to make sure they are all from real EU citizens. If the signatures are valid, the ECI can move on to the next step.

3. **The European Commission's response**: The European Commission then has to decide whether to take action on the ECI. They can either:
   - Propose a new law, like the ECI asks for.
   - Explain why they can't propose a new law, and what they can do instead.
   - Do nothing, if the ECI doesn't fit with what the EU can do.

4. **The European Parliament and Council**: If the European Commission decides to propose a new law, it then goes to the European Parliament and the Council of the EU for them to discuss and decide whether to make it a real law.

So, the ECI is a way for EU citizens to have a say in what laws the EU makes. It's like a big suggestion box, but with a lot of rules to make sure it works fairly. It's a great way for people to come together and try to make
