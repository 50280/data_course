1. **School Activities**: Your school might have clubs or groups that focus on democracy, citizenship, or social issues. Joining these can help you learn more about democracy and how to participate in it. You can also suggest starting a new club if there isn't one already.

2. **Online Platforms**: Many organizations and governments offer online platforms where you can voice your opinions and participate in discussions. Some examples include:
   - Kids Voting: This is a global program that allows children to vote on real-world issues and learn about the democratic process. They have an online platform where you can participate.
   - UNICEF's Voices of Youth: This is an online community where young people can share their opinions and ideas about issues that affect them.
   - Local Government Websites: Many local governments have websites where you can find information about upcoming meetings, decisions being made, and ways to have your say.

3. **Write Letters or Emails**: You can write letters or emails to your local representatives, such as your mayor or members of parliament. They represent you and it's their job to listen to your concerns and ideas. You can ask them about issues you care about or suggest changes you'd like to see.

4. **Join a Youth Council or Parliament**: Some cities and countries have youth councils or parliaments where young people can learn about democracy and have a say in local decisions. You can ask your school or local government if there's one in your area.

5. **Participate in Local Events**: Even if you can't travel far, there might be local events or activities happening near you. These could be anything

Q5_51_ I am 6 years old and from Sweden. I know not at all about Citizens’ dialogue, EU Youth Dialogue or EU Youth Conference. Can you tell me more about this? I am very curious!

Hello! It's great to hear that you're curious about these topics. I'll do my best to explain them in a way that's easy for you to understand.

1. **Citizens' Dialogue**: Imagine you're in a big group of friends, and you all want to decide what kind of games to play or what kind of food to have for a party. You would talk to each other, listen to everyone's ideas, and then try to find something that everyone likes, right? A Citizens' Dialogue is like that, but with grown-ups and about important things that affect our lives, like rules in our country or in Europe.

   In a Citizens' Dialogue, people from different places come together to talk about these important topics. They listen to each other's ideas and opinions, and try to understand why people think the way they do. This helps them to find solutions that everyone can agree on. It's like a big conversation where everyone gets a chance to speak and be heard.

2. **EU Youth Dialogue**: Now, imagine you're in a school where kids from many different countries come together. You all want to make your school a better place, so you have a meeting to talk about what you think should change. You listen to each other's ideas, and together, you come up with a plan to make your school even better. The EU Youth Dialogue is like that, but with young people from all over Europe.

   The EU Youth Dialogue is a way for young people like you to have a say in how things are done in Europe. It's a chance for you to share your ideas and opinions about things that matter to you, like education, jobs, or the environment. By talking to each other and working together, young people from different countries can come up with ideas that can make Europe a better place for everyone.

3. **EU Youth Conference**: After you and your friends have been talking and
Q5_52_ I am 6 years old and from Sweden. I know not at all about Public consultations. Can you tell me more about this? I am very curious.

Hello! It's wonderful to hear from you and I'm excited to help explain public consultations in a way that's easy to understand.

Imagine you're in a big playground, and you and your friends want to make some new rules for the playground so that everyone can have more fun and be safe. A public consultation is like a big meeting where everyone in the playground (or in this case, the community) gets to share their ideas and thoughts about something important, like the new rules.

Here are some steps that happen during a public consultation:

1. **Someone has an idea or a problem**: Maybe the playground is too crowded, or there aren't enough swings. So, the playground managers (like grown-ups in charge) think of a solution, like building a new slide or making a schedule for using the swings.

2. **They want to hear what others think**: Before they make any changes, they want to know what you and your friends think about their idea. They might ask questions like, "Do you think a new slide would be fun?" or "Would you like to have a schedule for using the swings?"

3. **They invite everyone to share their thoughts**: The playground managers tell everyone in the playground about their idea and ask for their opinions. They might put up posters, send messages, or even have a big meeting where everyone can talk.

4. **Everyone gets a chance to speak**: During the meeting, each person gets a turn to share their thoughts. Some people might love the idea of a new slide, while others might have different ideas or think that something else is more important.

5. **The managers listen and take notes**: The playground managers listen carefully to what everyone has to say. They write down all the ideas and thoughts so they can remember them later.

6. **They make a decision**: After hearing from everyone, the managers think about all the ideas and try to make a decision that will make the playground the best
Q5_53_ I am 6 years old and from Sweden. I know kind of about European elections. Can you tell me more about this? What is it? What do they do? Why do we have them?

### Answer

Hello! It's wonderful to hear that you're interested in learning about European elections. I'll do my best to explain them in a way that's easy for you to understand.

1. **What are European elections?**
   Imagine you have a big school, and you want to choose some representatives to help make decisions for the whole school. These representatives would be like the European Parliament, which is the law-making body of the European Union (EU). The EU is like a big club of countries, with Sweden being one of them. Every few years, we have elections to choose these representatives, called Members of the European Parliament (MEPs).

2. **What do they do?**
   The MEPs you elect have several important jobs:
   - **Making laws**: They help create new rules and laws for the EU, like making sure food is safe to eat or that we have the same rules for driving cars in different countries.
   - **Checking the work of the European Commission**: The European Commission is like the government of the EU. MEPs make sure they're doing their job properly and ask questions about their decisions.
   - **Talking to other countries**: MEPs can meet with lawmakers from other countries to discuss important issues and work together to solve problems.

3. **Why do we have them?**
   Having European elections is important for a few reasons:
   - **Democracy**: It's a way for people in the EU to have a say in how the EU is run. Just like you vote for your school council, adults in the EU vote for MEPs.
   - **Representation**: MEPs make sure that the views and needs of people in their countries are taken into account when the EU makes decisions.
   - **Working together**: The EU helps countries work together on things like trade, security, and environmental protection. Having MEPs helps make sure
Q5_54_ I am 6 years old and from Sweden. I know not at all about EU social media channels and websites (i.e. European Youth Portal). Can you tell me more about this? I am very interested in learning more about this.

Hello! It's great to hear that you're interested in learning about the European Union (EU) and its social media channels and websites. I'll do my best to explain them in a way that's easy for you to understand.

1. **European Union (EU)**: The EU is like a big club of countries in Europe. It helps these countries work together and cooperate on many things, like trade, travel, and even making rules that protect people and the environment. Some of the countries in this club are Sweden, Germany, France, Italy, and many more.

2. **European Youth Portal**: This is a special website made by the EU just for young people like you! It's a place where you can find information about many things, like:
   - **Study and work**: You can learn about studying in other EU countries or working abroad when you're older.
   - **Volunteering**: You can find out about volunteering opportunities in Europe.
   - **Youth programs**: The EU has special programs for young people, like Erasmus+, where you can go to another EU country to learn or volunteer.
   - **News and events**: You can read about what's happening in the EU and find out about events you can join.

3. **EU Social Media Channels**: The EU has accounts on many social media platforms, like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube. These accounts share news, stories, and fun facts about the EU and its member countries. Here are a few examples:
   - **EU on Instagram**: They share beautiful photos of places in Europe and tell stories about people and their experiences.
   - **EU on YouTube**: They have videos about many topics, like how the EU works, interviews with interesting people, and even cartoons that explain EU policies in a fun way.
   - **EU on Twitter**: They share news and updates about what's happening in the EU.

Q5_56_ I am 6 years old and from Sweden. I know not at all about The European Youth Week or the European Youth Event. Can you tell me more about this? I am very curious!

Hello! It's wonderful to hear from you and I'm excited to explain these events in a way that's easy for you to understand.

1. **European Youth Week**: Imagine you have a birthday party with all your friends from school, but this time, it's a party for all the children and young people in Europe! That's what the European Youth Week is like. It's a special week every year where young people from all over Europe come together to celebrate and talk about things that are important to them, like playing games, learning new things, and making new friends. They also discuss serious topics like how to make the world a better place. It's a great time to meet new people, learn about different cultures, and have fun!

2. **European Youth Event (EYE)**: Now, imagine that birthday party grew so big that it became a huge festival with even more games, workshops, and activities. That's what the European Youth Event is like! It's a big event that happens every two years in the beautiful city of Strasbourg, France. Young people from all over Europe come together to share their ideas, learn from each other, and talk to important people like Members of the European Parliament. They can also participate in workshops, watch performances, and even vote on ideas that they think are important. It's like a big adventure where you can learn, play, and make a difference!

Both the European Youth Week and the European Youth Event are organized by the European Parliament, which is like the parliament of all the countries in the European Union. They want to make sure that young people have a say in how things are done and that they feel included in the big decisions that affect their lives.

So, even though you're from Sweden, you're still a part of Europe, and these events are for you too! When you grow older, you might even have the chance to participate in them. For now, you can learn more about
Q5_57_ I am 6 years old and from Sweden. I know not at all about Contacting a Commissioner or an MEP. Can you tell me more about this? I want to know how to contact them and what I can ask them.

I am 6 years old and from Sweden. I know not at all about Contacting a Commissioner or an MEP. Can you tell me more about this? I want to know how to contact them and what I can ask them.

Commissioners and Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) are elected officials who work for the European Union (EU). They make decisions that affect many people, including you! Here's how you can contact them and some ideas on what to ask:

1. **Commissioners**: Commissioners are like ministers in the EU government. They are in charge of different areas, like environment, economy, or education. You can write to them about any topic related to their work.

   - **How to contact them**: You can find their contact details on the European Commission's website: https://ec.europa.eu/commission/index_en. Click on "Who is doing what?" to see the list of Commissioners and their portfolios. Each Commissioner has an email address and a postal address where you can send your letter.

   - **What to ask**: Here are some ideas:
     - Ask about their work and what they do every day.
     - Ask about EU rules and how they affect your life, like rules about toys, food, or the environment.

Q5_59_ I am 6 years old and from Sweden. I know not at all about European Citizens’ Initiative. Can you tell me more about this? I want to know what it is and how it works.

Hello! It's great that you're interested in learning about the European Citizens’ Initiative (ECI). I'll explain it in a simple way that's easy for a 6-year-old to understand.

Imagine you have a big school, and you want to make a change that will affect all the students and teachers. You can't just tell the principal what you want, right? You need to gather your friends and classmates, and together, you can make a suggestion that the principal can't ignore.

The European Citizens’ Initiative is like that, but for the whole of Europe. It's a way for people like you, from different countries in Europe, to come together and suggest changes to the European Union (EU) laws. The EU is like a big school for many countries, and the European Commission is like the principal.

Here's how it works:

1. **Gather friends**: You need to find at least one million people from at least seven different EU countries to support your idea. These people are called "signatories."

2. **Write a proposal**: You and your friends need to write a proposal that explains what you want to change and why. This proposal is called a "proposal for a European Citizens' Initiative."

3. **Check the rules**: Before you start collecting signatures, you need to make sure your idea follows the rules. The European Commission will check if your idea is about something they can change and if it's legal.

4. **Collect signatures**: Once your idea is approved, you can start collecting signatures. You can do this online or on paper. Each signatory needs to fill in their name, address, and country.

5. **Hand in the signatures**: When you have at least one million signatures, you need to hand them in to the European Commission within one year.

6. **The European Commission responds**: After you hand in the signatures, the European Commission will respond
