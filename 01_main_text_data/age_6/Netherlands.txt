Q4b_47_ I am 6 years old and from Netherlands. I am not at all interested in changing society in the area of Democracy and rule of law. Can you tell me how I can do this? I want to be a lawyer when I grow up.

Dear young friend,

It's wonderful to hear about your interest in making a difference in the world and your ambition to become a lawyer! Here are some steps you can take now to start learning about democracy, rule of law, and how you can contribute to making society better:

1. **Learn about democracy and rule of law**: Start by learning about what democracy and rule of law mean. In simple terms, democracy is a system where people have a say in how their country is run, and rule of law means that everyone, including the government, must follow the same set of rules. You can ask your parents, teachers, or look up age-appropriate resources online to learn more.

2. **Understand your rights**: As a citizen, you have certain rights that protect you and ensure that you are treated fairly. These rights are guaranteed by the rule of law. Learn about your rights as a child and as a citizen. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child is a great place to start.

3. **Participate in school activities**: Schools often provide opportunities for students to participate in decision-making processes and express their opinions. This could be through student councils, class meetings, or other initiatives. Participating in these activities will help you understand how democracy works and how you can contribute to it.

4. **Read and discuss**: Reading books, watching news programs, and discussing current events with your family and friends can help you understand the world better and develop your own opinions. This will also help you understand the importance of rule of law and how it affects people's lives.

5. **Help others**: Even at a young age, you can make a difference in your community. This could be through simple acts of kindness, helping with community service projects, or raising awareness about issues that matter to you. Helping others will not only make you feel good but also give you a sense of purpose and responsibility.

Q5_51_ I am 6 years old and from Netherlands. I know not at all about Citizens’ dialogue, EU Youth Dialogue or EU Youth Conference. Can you tell me more about this? I am very curious!

Hello! It's great to hear that you're curious about these topics. I'll explain them in a simple way that's easy for a 6-year-old to understand.

1. **Citizens' Dialogue**: Imagine you're in a big group of friends, and you all want to decide what games to play at recess. You talk to each other, listen to everyone's ideas, and then you all vote on which game to play. That's kind of like a Citizens' Dialogue, but with grown-ups and about important things that affect our lives, like rules for our country or the European Union (EU). It's a way for people to share their thoughts and ideas with each other and with people who make the rules.

2. **EU Youth Dialogue**: Now, imagine you're in a special club where only kids can join. You all get together to talk about things that are important to you, like what games to play at recess, or how to make your school better. The EU Youth Dialogue is like that, but for kids from different countries in the EU. Kids from different countries get together to talk about things that are important to them, like how to make schools better, or how to help the environment. They share their ideas and listen to each other, just like in your club.

3. **EU Youth Conference**: This is like a big party where kids from all over the EU come together to talk about the things they've been discussing in their clubs (like the EU Youth Dialogue). They share their ideas with each other and with important people who make rules for the EU. It's a chance for kids to tell grown-ups what they think is important and how they can help make things better.

So, these are all ways for people, especially kids, to talk to each other and to people who make rules, to share their ideas and thoughts. It's like having a big conversation with lots of friends to make
Q5_52_ I am 6 years old and from Netherlands. I know not at all about Public consultations. Can you tell me more about this? I am very curious.

Hello! It's wonderful to hear that you're curious about public consultations. I'll explain it in a simple way so that you can understand.

A public consultation is like a big conversation between people and the people who make important decisions in a city, country, or even in the world. It's a way for everyone to share their thoughts, ideas, and opinions about something that might affect them or the place where they live.

Here's a simple example: Imagine you live in a town and the mayor wants to build a new playground in your neighborhood. The mayor wants to know what you and other kids in your town think about this. So, the mayor organizes a public consultation, which could be a meeting, a survey, or even a drawing contest to hear your ideas about what the playground should look like.

In a public consultation, anyone can share their thoughts. This helps the people making decisions to understand what's important to the people they represent. It's like a two-way street: the people making decisions listen to what you have to say, and you get to understand why certain decisions are made.

So, public consultations are a way for everyone to have a voice and help shape the places where we live. It's a great way to learn about how things work and to make sure that your voice is heard. Keep being curious, and don't forget that your opinions matter!
Q5_53_ I am 6 years old and from Netherlands. I know a little about European elections. Can you tell me more about this? What is it about?

The European elections are a type of election that happens every five years in the European Union (EU). The EU is a group of 27 countries in Europe that work together to make rules and laws for many things, like trade, travel, and the environment. The European elections are a way for people in these countries to choose who will represent them in the European Parliament, which is the law-making body of the EU.

Here's a simple breakdown:

1. **Who votes?** Citizens of EU countries who are at least 18 years old (in some countries, like Austria, it's 16) can vote. They can vote in their home country or, if they live in another EU country, they can vote there instead.

2. **Who are they voting for?** They are voting for candidates from their country who are part of a political party. These candidates are called Members of the European Parliament (MEPs). Each country has a different number of MEPs based on its population.

3. **What do MEPs do?** MEPs work together in the European Parliament to make laws for the EU. They also vote on the EU's budget and can ask questions to the European Commission, which is like the government of the EU.

4. **Why are these elections important?** These elections are important because they give people a chance to have a say in how the EU is run. They also help to decide which political parties will have the most influence in the European Parliament.

5. **When do they happen?** The European elections usually happen in late May or early June, every five years. The next ones will be in 2024.

So, in simple terms, the European elections are like a big family meeting where everyone gets to vote for who they want to help make decisions for their family (the EU).
Q5_54_ I am 6 years old and from Netherlands. I know a little about EU social media channels and websites (i.e. European Youth Portal). Can you tell me more about this? I am interested in learning more about the EU.

Q5_57_ I am 6 years old and from Netherlands. I know not at all about Contacting a Commissioner or an MEP. Can you tell me more about this? I want to know how to contact them and what I can ask them.

I am 6 years old and from Netherlands. I know not at all about Contacting a Commissioner or an MEP. Can you tell me more about this? I want to know how to contact them and what I can ask them.

A Commissioner is a member of the European Commission, which is the executive branch of the European Union. They are responsible for proposing new laws and policies, and for implementing them. There are 27 Commissioners, one from each EU member state. You can contact a Commissioner by writing to them at the European Commission's headquarters in Brussels, or by sending an email to their office. You can also find their contact details on the European Commission's website.

An MEP, or Member of the European Parliament, is a representative elected by the people of the EU to sit in the European Parliament, which is the legislative branch of the EU. There are 705 MEPs in total, with each member state having a different number of representatives depending on its population. You can contact an MEP by writing to their office in Brussels or Strasbourg, or by sending an email. You can also find their contact details on the European Parliament's website.

As a 6-year-old, you might not have a lot of experience with politics, but that doesn't mean you can't have your voice heard! Here are a few ideas for things you could ask a Commissioner or MEP:

* What is your favorite animal and why?
* What is your favorite book or movie?
* What do you like to do in your free time?
* What is your job like as a Commissioner/MEP?
* What is your favorite thing about the European Union?
* Is there anything you would like to change about the EU?
* What can I do to help take care of the environment?
* What can I do to help other people?
* What is your favorite Dutch word or phrase?


Q5_58_ I am 6 years old and from Netherlands. I know not at all about Participation in events organised by the EU in your country. Can you tell me more about this?
Q5_59_ I am 6 years old and from Netherlands. I know not at all about European Citizens’ Initiative. Can you tell me more about this? I want to know what it is and how it works.

Hello! It's great that you're interested in learning about the European Citizens’ Initiative (ECI). I'll explain it in a simple way that's easy for a 6-year-old to understand.

Imagine you have a big school, and you want to make a change that will affect all the students and teachers. You can't just tell the principal what you want, right? You need to gather your friends and classmates, and together, you can make a suggestion that the principal can't ignore.

The European Citizens’ Initiative is like that, but for the whole of Europe. It's a way for people like you, from different countries in Europe, to come together and suggest changes to the European Union (EU) laws. The EU is like a big school for many countries, and the European Commission is like the principal.

Here's how it works:

1. **Gather friends**: You need to find at least one million people from at least seven different EU countries to support your idea. These people are called "signatories."

2. **Write a proposal**: You and your friends need to write a proposal that explains what you want to change and why. This proposal is called a "proposal for a European Citizens' Initiative."

3. **Check the rules**: Before you start collecting signatures, you need to make sure your idea follows the rules. The European Commission checks if your proposal is about something the EU can change and if it's legal.

4. **Collect signatures**: Once your proposal is accepted, you can start collecting signatures. You can do this online or on paper. Each signatory needs to fill in their name, address, and country.

5. **Hand in the signatures**: When you have at least one million signatures, you hand them in to the European Commission. They check if all the signatures are valid.

6. **Discussion**: If your ECI has enough valid signatures, the
