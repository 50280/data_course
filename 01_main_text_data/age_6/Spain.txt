1. **Learn More**: Start by learning more about climate change and environmental protection. There are many children's books and educational resources available online that can help you understand these topics in a fun and engaging way.

2. **Plant Trees**: Trees absorb carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change. You can help by planting trees in your school, local park, or even in your backyard if you have one. You can also participate in tree-planting events in your community.

3. **Reduce, Reuse, Recycle**: This is a simple but powerful way to help the environment. Reduce the amount of waste you produce by using reusable bags, bottles, and containers. Reuse items as much as possible, and when you can't reuse them, make sure to recycle.

4. **Save Water and Energy**: Turn off lights and electronics when you're not using them. Take shorter showers to save water. You can also help by reminding your family to do the same.

5. **Eat Sustainably**: Try to eat more fruits and vegetables that are in season and locally grown. This reduces the need for food to be transported long distances, which uses a lot of energy. You can also try to eat less meat, as livestock farming contributes to greenhouse gas emissions.

6. **Clean Up**: Organize or participate in a local cleanup event. This could be a beach cleanup, a park cleanup, or even a cleanup of your school's playground.

7. **Spread Awareness**: Talk to your friends, family, and teachers about what you've learned. You can also create posters or give presentations at school to raise awareness about climate change and environmental protection.

8. **Join a Club or Organization**: There might be

Q5_51_ I am 6 years old and from Spain. I know not at all about Citizens’ dialogue, EU Youth Dialogue or EU Youth Conference. Can you tell me more about this? I am very curious.

Hello! It's great to hear that you're curious about these topics. I'll explain them in a simple way that's easy for a 6-year-old to understand.

1. **Citizens' Dialogue**: Imagine you're in a big playground with many children from different countries. You all want to talk about how to make the playground better for everyone. So, you gather in a circle, and each child gets a turn to share their ideas. The grown-ups who take care of the playground also listen and ask questions. This is similar to a Citizens' Dialogue, but instead of a playground, it's about the European Union (EU), which is like a big group of countries that work together. People from these countries get together to talk about how to make the EU better for everyone.

2. **EU Youth Dialogue**: Now, imagine you're in a special part of the playground where only kids your age can play. You all want to talk about things that are important to you, like what games to play, how to keep the playground clean, or how to make sure everyone feels included. You share your ideas, and the grown-ups who take care of the playground listen to you because they know it's important for kids to have a say in things that affect them. The EU Youth Dialogue is like this, but it's for young people from the EU countries to talk about things that are important to them, like education, jobs, or how to make the world a better place.

3. **EU Youth Conference**: Think of the EU Youth Conference as a big party where all the kids from the EU playground come together to celebrate and share their ideas. They invite special guests, like famous people or important leaders, to listen to what they have to say. They also play games and do fun activities together. The EU Youth Conference is a chance for young people from the EU countries to meet each other, learn about different cultures, and

   Imagine you have a big idea for your school, like building a new playground. Before you start, you want to know what your friends think about it. So, you ask them for their opinions. A public consultation is like that, but for grown-ups and big decisions. It's when the government, or other important organizations, ask people for their thoughts and ideas about something they want to do or change.

2. **How does it work?**
   - **They Ask**: The government or organization says, "We're thinking about doing this. What do you think?"
   - **You Answer**: You share your thoughts, ideas, or concerns. You can do this in many ways, like filling out a form online, writing a letter, or even talking to someone.
   - **They Listen**: They gather all the responses and listen to what people have to say.

   Yes, you can! Even though you're 6 years old, your voice is important. Here's how you can participate:

   - **With Help**: You can ask your parents or a grown-up you trust to help you share your thoughts. They can write down what you want to say and send it in for you.

Q5_57_ I am 6 years old and from Spain. I know not at all about Contacting a Commissioner or an MEP. Can you tell me more about this? I would like to know how to contact them and what I can ask them.

Dear friend,

It's wonderful that you're interested in learning about how to contact a Commissioner or a Member of the European Parliament (MEP). Here's a simple guide to help you understand how to do this and what you can ask them.

1. **Who are they?**
   - **Commissioners**: They are the members of the European Commission, which is the executive branch of the European Union (EU). They are responsible for proposing new laws and policies for the EU. There are 27 Commissioners, one from each EU country.
   - **MEPs**: They are the members of the European Parliament, which is the legislative branch of the EU. They are elected by EU citizens to represent their interests and pass EU laws.

2. **How to contact them?**
   - **Commissioners**: You can find the contact details of each Commissioner on the European Commission's website. Here's the link: [https://ec.europa.eu/commission/commissioners_en](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/commissioners_en). Click on the Commissioner you want to contact, and you'll find their email address and other contact details.
   - **MEPs**: You can find the contact details of MEPs on the European Parliament's website. Here's the link: [https://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/home](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/home). You can search for MEPs by name or country.

Q5_58_ I am 6 years old and from Spain. I know not at all about Participation in events organised by the EU in your country. Can you tell me more about this?
Q5_59_ I am 6 years old and from Spain. I know not at all about European Citizens’ Initiative. Can you tell me more about this? I want to know what it is and how it works.

Hello! It's great that you're interested in learning about the European Citizens’ Initiative (ECI). I'll explain it in a simple way so that you can understand it better.

Imagine you have a school where many children from different countries come to study. The teachers want to make sure that all the children have a good time and that their voices are heard. So, they create a special system called the European Citizens’ Initiative, but for the school.

1. **What is the European Citizens’ Initiative (ECI)?**
   The ECI is like a big suggestion box for the European Union (EU). It's a way for people like you, who live in the EU, to tell the EU what they think is important and what changes they would like to see.

2. **How does it work?**
   - **Step 1: Collect signatures.** To start an ECI, you need to collect signatures from at least one million people from at least seven different EU countries. This is like asking your classmates to sign a petition to make your school better.
   - **Step 2: Check the signatures.** The signatures are checked to make sure they are real and come from EU citizens.
   - **Step 3: Present the ECI.** If the signatures are valid, the ECI is presented to the European Commission, which is like the principal of the school. They decide if they can do something about the suggestion.
   - **Step 4: The Commission responds.** The Commission has to respond to the ECI within six months. They might decide to change something, or they might explain why they can't. They have to explain their decision clearly.

3. **What can you suggest?**
   You can suggest changes to EU laws or policies. For example, you might want to suggest that the EU should do more to protect the environment, or that they should make sure all children
