It's wonderful to hear that you're already thinking about how to make the world a better place, especially in the area of health and well-being. Here are some steps you can take, even at your young age, to start making a difference:

1. **Learn and Understand**: Start by learning more about health and well-being. You can ask your parents, teachers, or even doctors about different health topics. There are also many children's books and online resources that can help you understand these concepts in a fun and easy way.

2. **Practice Healthy Habits**: Lead by example. Make sure you're eating healthy foods, drinking plenty of water, getting enough sleep, and exercising regularly. This will not only help you stay healthy but also inspire others around you to do the same.

3. **Help Others**: Even at your age, you can help others in your community. You could help your parents or grandparents with their daily tasks, or you could participate in community service activities if there are any suitable for your age group.

4. **Spread Awareness**: You can create posters or drawings about the importance of health and well-being and share them with your friends, family, or even your school. You could also talk about these topics in your school projects or presentations.

5. **Fundraise**: If there's a specific health cause you're passionate about, you could organize a small fundraiser. This could be anything from a lemonade stand to a bake sale. The money you raise could go towards a local hospital, a health-related charity, or a cause that supports health and well-being in your community.

6. **Be Kind and Compassionate**: Remember, health and well-being aren't just about physical health. Mental health is also very important. Be kind and compassionate to others. Bullying and negativity can have a big impact on someone's mental health.

Dear friend,

It's wonderful to hear that you're already thinking about how to make the world a better place, especially when it comes to equal rights for everyone, regardless of their gender, race, or sexuality. Here are some steps you can take to become a leader in this area, even at your young age:

1. **Educate Yourself**: Learn as much as you can about different cultures, genders, and sexualities. This will help you understand the importance of equality and the challenges that people face. You can start by asking your parents, teachers, or librarians for books, movies, or websites that can help you learn more.

2. **Talk to Others**: Share what you've learned with your friends, family, and classmates. You can start conversations about why it's important to treat everyone equally and fairly. Remember, it's okay if people don't understand at first. It's important to keep talking and listening.

3. **Be Kind and Inclusive**: Treat everyone with kindness and respect. Make sure that your games and activities are inclusive and fun for everyone, regardless of their differences. If you see someone being left out or treated unfairly, stand up for them.

4. **Use Your Voice**: If you see something that's not fair, don't be afraid to speak up. You can write letters, make posters, or even give a speech at school about the importance of equal rights. Remember, your voice is powerful and can make a difference.

5. **Join or Start a Club**: See if there's a club or group at your school that focuses on social justice or equality. If there isn't, you could start one with the help of a teacher or parent. This can be a great way to meet other kids who care about these issues and to make a difference together.

6. **Help in Your Community**: Look for ways to help in your community. This could be

Q4b_46_ I am 6 years old and from Lithuania. I am a little interested in changing society in the area of Wars and conflicts. Can you tell me how I can do this? I want to be a peacekeeper.

Dear friend,

It's wonderful to hear that you're already thinking about how to make the world a more peaceful place! Here are some steps you can take, even at your young age:

1. **Learn about Peace**: Start by learning more about peace, peacekeepers, and why wars happen. You can ask your parents, teachers, or librarians to help you find books, videos, or websites that explain these topics in a way that's easy for you to understand.

2. **Spread Kindness**: Begin by making your own home, school, and community a more peaceful place. Treat others with kindness and respect. Stand up for others if you see someone being bullied or treated unfairly. Remember, every small act of kindness can make a big difference.

3. **Share Your Ideas**: Talk to your family, friends, and teachers about your dream of becoming a peacekeeper. You might inspire others to think about peace too. You can also write about your ideas or draw pictures to express them.

4. **Join or Start a Peace Club**: See if there's a peace club at your school or in your community. If there isn't, you could start one with the help of a teacher or parent. You can organize activities that promote peace, like planting trees, cleaning up your neighborhood, or having discussions about how to resolve conflicts peacefully.

5. **Help Others**: Look for ways to help people in need, whether it's in your own community or around the world. You could collect toys for children who don't have any, or raise money for a charity that helps people affected by wars.

6. **Educate Yourself**: Keep learning about different cultures, histories, and religions. The more you understand about the world, the better you'll be able to understand why conflicts happen and how to prevent them.

7. **Be Patient and Persistent**: Making the world a more peaceful place is a big task

Q5_51_ I am 6 years old and from Lithuania. I know not at all about Citizens’ dialogue, EU Youth Dialogue or EU Youth Conference. Can you tell me more about this? I am very curious.

Dear friend,

I'm glad you're curious about these topics! Let's imagine you're in a big playground called Europe, where many children from different countries come to play together. This playground has some special rules and activities that make it fun for everyone.

1. **Citizens' Dialogue**: Imagine you're playing with your friends, and sometimes you have disagreements about how to play a game or share toys. To solve these issues, you all sit down and talk about your ideas, listen to each other, and try to find a solution that everyone likes. This is similar to a Citizens' Dialogue. In the big playground of Europe, grown-ups from different countries also talk to each other about important issues, like how to make the playground better for everyone. They share their ideas, listen to each other, and try to find solutions together. This helps them understand each other better and work together to make the playground a happier place.

2. **EU Youth Dialogue**: Now, imagine there's a special club in the playground where only children can join. In this club, you can talk about things that are important to you, like how to make recess more fun or how to help other children who might be feeling left out. The grown-ups listen to what you have to say and try to help you make changes that will make the playground even better. The EU Youth Dialogue is like this club, but for young people from all over Europe. They talk about issues that are important to them, like education, jobs, or the environment, and the grown-ups in charge of the playground listen to their ideas and try to help them make a difference.

3. **EU Youth Conference**: Finally, imagine that every year, the playground organizes a big party where children from all over the world can come and share their ideas about how to make playgrounds better for everyone. They can talk about what they've learned from playing with different children, what challenges they

Q5_56_ I am 6 years old and from Lithuania. I know a little about The European Youth Week or the European Youth Event. Can you tell me more about this? What is it? What do young people do there? What is the purpose of this event?

The European Youth Week and the European Youth Event are initiatives organized by the European Union to engage and involve young people in the democratic life of Europe. Here's a simple explanation for you:

1. **European Youth Week**: This is a week-long event that happens every year in May. It's like a big party where young people from all over Europe come together to celebrate their diversity, share their ideas, and learn about each other's cultures. During this week, there are many activities like workshops, games, concerts, and discussions. Young people can talk about things that are important to them, like the environment, education, or their future. The purpose of the European Youth Week is to make young people feel more connected to Europe and to each other.

2. **European Youth Event (EYE)**: This is a bigger event that happens every two years in the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France. It's like a big meeting where young people from all over Europe come to share their ideas and opinions with Members of the European Parliament. They can discuss topics like climate change, digital technologies, or how to make Europe a better place. The purpose of the EYE is to give young people a voice in Europe and to help them understand how the European Union works.

In both events, young people can meet new friends, learn new things, and have fun while also making their voices heard. It's a great way to be part of something big and important!

Q5_59_ I am 6 years old and from Lithuania. I know not at all about European Citizens’ Initiative. Can you tell me more about this? I am very curious.

Dear friend,

I'm delighted to help explain the European Citizens' Initiative (ECI) in a way that's easy for you to understand!

Imagine you have a great idea that you think could make Europe a better place. The ECI is like a special way for you, and other European citizens like you, to share your idea with the European Commission, which is like the government of Europe. Here's how it works:

1. **Collect signatures**: First, you need to find other people who like your idea. You need to collect at least one million signatures from at least seven different European countries. This is like asking your friends and family to support your idea.

2. **Register your initiative**: Once you have collected the signatures, you need to register your initiative with the European Commission. This is like officially telling them about your idea.

3. **The European Commission responds**: After you've registered your initiative, the European Commission will look at your idea. If they think it's a good one, they might decide to do something about it. They will then tell you and all the people who signed your initiative what they plan to do.

4. **You can change Europe**: If the European Commission decides to act on your idea, you've helped to change Europe for the better! This is a really special way for citizens to have a say in how Europe works.

So, even though you're just 6 years old, you can start thinking about what you care about and what you'd like to change in Europe. When you grow up, you might even start your own ECI!
