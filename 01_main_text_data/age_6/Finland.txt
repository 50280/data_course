2. **Participate in School Elections**: If your school has student elections for the school council, make sure to vote! If you're old enough, you could even run for a position. This is a great way to practice democracy and learn about leadership.

3. **Write Letters or Emails**: If you have an idea or concern about your school or city, you can write a letter or email to the principal, mayor, or other local leaders. They might not always be able to implement your ideas, but they'll appreciate hearing from you and may consider your suggestions in the future.

4. **Join or Start a Club**: Start or join a club focused on issues you care about, like environmental protection, animal welfare, or social justice. This can help you connect with like-minded peers and make a difference together.

5. **Attend Local Events and Meetings**: Check if there are any local events, meetings, or workshops where you can learn more about your city and how it's run. You might be able to share
Q3_33_ I am 6 years old and from Finland. I have never taken part in activities that relate to democratic participation because These activities are too far away. It is difficult to get there from my home  (e.g. by public transport). For my friends, this is kind of the same. Can you tell me more about how I can do that? I would like to participate in activities that relate to democratic participation.

Dear friend,

It's wonderful to hear that you're interested in democratic participation at such a young age! There are indeed many ways you can get involved, even if some activities might be far away or require transportation. Here are some suggestions tailored to your situation:

1. **Local Activities**: Start by looking for local events and activities in your community. These could be closer to home and easier to reach. You can ask your parents, teachers, or local community centers about these opportunities. Some examples might include:
   - Participating in local school council meetings or student government.
   - Joining a local youth club or organization that focuses on social issues or community service.
   - Attending local events like town halls, community meetings, or environmental clean-up days.

2. **Online Platforms**: With the help of your parents, you can explore online platforms that allow you to participate in democratic processes and discussions. These can be accessed from the comfort of your home. Some examples include:
   - Kids Voting: A global program that allows children to vote in mock elections, learning about the democratic process. (https://www.kidsvotingusa.org/)
   - DoSomething.org: A platform where you can join campaigns and take action on issues you care about. (https://www.dosomething.org/)
   - UNICEF's Voices of Youth: A platform where young people can share their opinions and ideas on various issues. (https://www.voicesofyouth.org/)

3. **Public Transportation**: If you're interested in participating in activities that require public transportation, you can ask your parents to help you plan your journey. You could also consider joining a group of friends or classmates who are also interested in the activity, as traveling together can make the journey more enjoyable and safer.

4. **Write or Draw**: You can express your opinions and ideas through writing letters to local politicians, newspapers, or drawing
Q4b_41_ I am 6 years old and from Finland. I am a little interested in changing society in the area of Climate change and environmental protection. Can you tell me how I can do this? I want to do something good for the world.

Hello! It's wonderful to hear that you're already thinking about how to make a positive impact on the world at such a young age. Here are some ways you can start making a difference, especially in the areas of climate change and environmental protection:

1. **Learn More**: The first step is to understand the issues better. You can ask your parents or teachers to help you find age-appropriate books, videos, or websites that explain climate change and environmental protection in a simple way. Some recommendations include "The Lorax" by Dr. Seuss, "The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind" by William Kamkwamba, and the website FuseSchool (https://www.fuseschool.org/).

2. **Talk About It**: Share what you've learned with your friends, family, and classmates. You can start conversations about why it's important to protect the environment and how everyone can help. You might even inspire others to take action too!

3. **Reduce, Reuse, Recycle**: Help your family and school reduce waste by recycling, composting, and reusing items whenever possible. You can also encourage others to do the same.

4. **Save Energy**: Turn off lights and electronics when you're not using them. You can also help your family switch to energy-efficient light bulbs and appliances.

5. **Plant Trees**: Trees absorb carbon dioxide from the air, so planting more of them can help reduce the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. You can start a small garden at home or participate in local tree-planting events.

6. **Protect Wildlife**: You can help protect local wildlife by creating a safe space for them in your backyard or neighborhood. This could be as simple as putting up a bird feeder or creating a small pond.

7. **Educate Others**: Organize a small event or presentation at your school or in your community to teach others about climate

3. **Use Your Voice**: If you see something that's not fair, don't be afraid to speak up. You can talk to your parents, teachers, or other adults you trust about what you've seen and how you feel. They can help you figure out what to do.

4. **Educate Others**: Share what you've learned with others. You can teach your friends about the importance of equality, or you can create a poster or a presentation to share with your class or family.

5. **Participate in Community Events**: Look for events in your community that support equality, like pride parades, cultural festivals, or charity events. Ask your parents if you can participate. This can be a fun way to learn more and show your support.

6. **Write Letters or Draw Pictures**: You can write letters to your local leaders, or draw pictures to express your feelings about equality. This can help others understand why these issues are important.

Q5_51_ I am 6 years old and from Finland. I know not at all about Citizens’ dialogue, EU Youth Dialogue or EU Youth Conference. Can you tell me more about this? I am very interested in this.

Dear friend,

It's wonderful to hear that you're interested in learning about the EU Youth Dialogue, Citizens' Dialogue, and the EU Youth Conference! I'll do my best to explain these in a way that's easy for you to understand.

1. **EU Youth Dialogue**: Imagine you're in a big school, and you want to talk to all your classmates about what you think is important for your school. The EU Youth Dialogue is like that, but for young people in the European Union (EU). It's a way for young people like you to share their ideas and opinions about things that matter to them, like education, jobs, or the environment. These ideas are then collected and given to people who make decisions in the EU, so they can consider them when they're making new rules or plans. Isn't that cool? You can be a part of this by talking to your friends, family, and teachers about what you think is important, and then sharing those ideas with others.

2. **Citizens' Dialogue**: Now, imagine you're at a big party with people from all over Europe. At this party, everyone gets a chance to talk about what they think is important for Europe. The Citizens' Dialogue is like that party. It's a way for people from all over the EU to come together and share their thoughts and ideas about Europe's future. This could be about things like how to make Europe a better place to live, or how to protect the environment. Just like the EU Youth Dialogue, the ideas shared at these dialogues are collected and given to people who make decisions in the EU.

3. **EU Youth Conference**: The EU Youth Conference is like a big meeting where young people from all over Europe come together to talk about a specific topic. It's a chance for young people to share their ideas and experiences, and to learn from each other. After the conference, the young
Q5_52_ I am 6 years old and from Finland. I know not at all about Public consultations. Can you tell me more about this? I am very curious.

Hello! It's wonderful to hear that you're curious about public consultations. I'll explain it in a simple way so that you can understand.

A public consultation is like a big conversation between people and the people who make important decisions in a country or a city. It's a way for everyone to have a say in what happens in their community.

Imagine you're in a classroom, and the teacher wants to decide on a new game for recess. The teacher could just choose a game on their own, but that might not be fair because some kids might not like that game. So, the teacher asks everyone in the class what games they like, and then they all talk about it together. That's what a public consultation is like, but for bigger decisions that affect a whole city or country.

Here's how it works:

1. **Someone wants to make a change**: This could be a government, a city council, or even a big company. They want to do something new, like build a park, change a rule, or start a new service.

2. **They ask for your opinion**: They say, "Hey, we're thinking of doing this. What do you think? Is there something you'd like us to consider?"

3. **You share your thoughts**: You can tell them what you think about their idea. You can say if you like it, if you don't like it, or if you have a better idea.

4. **They listen and learn**: The people making the decision listen to what everyone has to say. They might change their idea based on what they hear.

5. **They make a decision**: After listening to everyone, they make a decision. Sometimes, they'll tell you what they decided and why.

Public consultations are important because they help make sure that everyone's voice is heard. It's like a big teamwork project, where everyone gets to help decide what's best for the community.

So,
Q5_53_ I am 6 years old and from Finland. I know kind of about European elections. Can you tell me more about this? What is it and how does it work?

Hello! It's great that you're interested in learning about European elections. I'll do my best to explain it in a simple way.

1. **What are European Elections?**
   Imagine you have a big school, and the school has a special club called the European Union (EU). This club has rules that all the schools (countries) in the EU must follow. The EU also makes decisions that affect all the students (citizens) in the EU, like what games (laws) they can play together. European Elections are like choosing the leaders of this special club. These leaders are called Members of the European Parliament (MEPs).

2. **Who can vote?**
   In the EU, there are 27 countries, and people who are at least 18 years old and are citizens of one of these countries can vote. Since you're 6, you'll have to wait a few more years to vote, but it's great that you're already interested!

3. **How does it work?**
   - **Voting**: On the day of the election, people go to a voting booth and choose the candidates they like the most. They can vote for a party or for individual candidates. The votes are then counted.
   - **Seats**: The EU has a big room called the European Parliament where all the MEPs sit. There are 705 seats in total, and each country gets a certain number of seats based on its size. For example, Germany gets the most seats because it has the most people, while smaller countries like Malta get fewer seats.
   - **Dividing Seats**: After the votes are counted, the seats are divided among the parties based on how many votes each party got. For example, if a party got 30% of the votes, they would get 30% of the seats for that country.
   - **Choosing
Q5_54_ I am 6 years old and from Finland. I know a little about EU social media channels and websites (i.e. European Youth Portal). Can you tell me more about this? I am interested in learning more about the EU.

Thank you for your question! I'm glad to hear that you're interested in learning more about the European Union (EU) at such a young age. The EU has several social media channels and websites that can help you learn more about it in a fun and interactive way. Here are a few you might find interesting:

1. **European Youth Portal (https://europa.eu/youth/)**: This is a great place to start! The portal is designed specifically for young people like you, and it provides information on various topics such as education, work, volunteering, and mobility opportunities within the EU. It also has a section called "Discover EU" where you can learn about the EU's history, institutions, and how it works.

2. **EU4Kids (https://europa.eu/european-union/eu4kids_en)**: This is a fun and interactive website designed for children aged 6 to 12. It explains what the EU is, how it works, and what it does in a simple and engaging way. You can learn about the EU's symbols, languages, and even play games!

3. **EU Social Media Channels**:
   - **YouTube**: The EU has a YouTube channel (https://www.youtube.com/user/EUeuropa) with videos on various topics, including animations that explain EU policies and institutions in a fun way.
   - **Facebook**: The EU has official pages in several languages. You can find them by searching for "European Union" on Facebook.
   - **Twitter**: The EU has official accounts in several languages. You can find them by searching for "@EU_Commission", "@EUCouncil", "@EUCouncilPress", "@EUCouncilFacts", etc.
   - **Instagram**: The EU has an official account (https://www.instagram.com/europeanunion/) where they share photos
Q5_55_ I am 6 years old and from Finland. I know not at all about Visit of the EU institutions. Can you tell me more about this? What is the EU?

The EU, or European Union, is a group of 27 countries that work together to make rules and laws that affect how they trade with each other and how their citizens can live, work, and travel within the EU. It was started in 1993, but the idea of countries working together in Europe has been around for a long time.

The EU has several institutions that help it make decisions and carry out its work. These include:

1. **European Parliament**: This is like a parliament, where elected members from each EU country meet to make laws and decide on how the EU's budget should be spent.

2. **European Council**: This is where the leaders of each EU country meet to discuss and decide on important issues.

3. **Council of the European Union**: This is where ministers from each EU country meet to discuss and decide on specific policy areas, like agriculture or justice.

4. **European Commission**: This is like the civil service of the EU. It proposes new laws, makes sure EU countries follow the rules, and manages the EU's budget.

5. **European Court of Justice**: This is the court that makes sure EU law is followed and solves any legal disputes between EU countries or institutions.

Now, about the "Visit of the EU institutions": This is not a specific event, but rather a general term that could refer to any visit by a group of people to one or more of the EU's institutions. For example, school groups, politicians, or journalists might visit the EU Parliament in Strasbourg, France, or the EU Commission in Brussels, Belgium, to learn more about how the EU works and to see how decisions are made.

So, in simple terms, the EU is a group of countries that work together, and the "Visit of the EU institutions" is a way to learn more about how this group makes decisions and carries out its work.

Q5_57_ I am 6 years old and from Finland. I know not at all about Contacting a Commissioner or an MEP. Can you tell me more about this? I am very interested in this topic.

Dear friend,

It's wonderful to hear that you're interested in learning about how to contact a Commissioner or a Member of the European Parliament (MEP). Here's a simple explanation and some steps to help you:

1. **Who are they?**
   - **Commissioner**: They are part of the European Commission, which is like the government of the European Union (EU). Each Commissioner is responsible for a specific area, like environment, economy, or education. They are appointed by the EU countries and approved by the European Parliament.
   - **MEP**: They are elected by voters in the EU countries to represent them in the European Parliament. They work together in political groups and have the power to make and change EU laws.

2. **Why contact them?**
   You might want to contact them if you have an idea or concern about something that affects the EU, like the environment, animals, or school. They can listen to your ideas and sometimes even help make changes.

3. **How to contact them?**

   - **Commissioner**:
     - Find the Commissioner who works on the topic you're interested in. You can find a list of Commissioners and their areas of work on the European Commission's website: https://ec.europa.eu/commission/index_en
     - Once you've found the right Commissioner, you can send them an email. You can find their email address on their webpage. Here's an example of how you might write your email:
       "Dear Commissioner [Name], I am [Your Name] from [Your Country]. I am [Your Age] years old and I have an idea about [Your Topic]. I think that [Your Idea]. I would be very happy if you could consider my idea. Thank you very much."

   - **MEP**:
     - Find your MEP by entering your address on the European Parliament's website: https://www.europarl.europa
Q5_58_ I am 6 years old and from Finland. I know not at all about Participation in events organised by the EU in your country. Can you tell me more about this?
Q5_59_ I am 6 years old and from Finland. I know a little about European Citizens’ Initiative. Can you tell me more about this? What is it?

A European Citizens’ Initiative (ECI) is a way for citizens of the European Union (EU) to propose new laws to the European Commission. It’s like a petition, but it’s special because it can change the laws of the whole EU if it gets enough support.

Here are some simple steps to understand how it works:

1. **Idea**: First, a group of citizens comes up with an idea for a new law or a change to an existing law. This idea should be about something that the EU can make laws about, like the environment, energy, or consumer protection.

2. **Proposal**: The group writes a proposal explaining their idea. They also need to gather support from at least one million EU citizens from at least seven different EU countries.

3. **Review**: The European Commission checks if the proposal is legal and falls within the EU’s powers. If it does, the ECI can start collecting signatures.

4. **Signatures**: The group has one year to collect signatures. Each signature must come from an EU citizen who is registered to vote in their country. The signatures are collected online, and each person must prove their identity.

5. **Success**: If the ECI gets at least one million signatures, the European Commission has to respond to the proposal. They can either:

   - **Propose a new law**: If they think the idea is good, they can propose a new law to the European Parliament and the Council of the EU.
   - **Explain why they won’t propose a new law**: If they don’t think the idea is good, they have to explain why.

So, an ECI is a way for EU citizens to have a say in the laws that affect them. It’s a way to make sure that the EU listens to the voices of its citizens.
