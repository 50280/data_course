Q4b_46_ I am 6 years old and from France. I am a little interested in changing society in the area of Wars and conflicts. Can you tell me how I can do this? I want to be a peacekeeper.

Dear young peacekeeper,

It's wonderful to hear that you're already thinking about how to make the world a more peaceful place! Here are some steps you can take, even at your young age:

1. **Learn and Understand**: Start by learning about different cultures, countries, and histories. This will help you understand why conflicts happen and how they can be resolved. You can read books, watch documentaries (age-appropriate ones), and talk to your parents, teachers, and friends about these topics.

2. **Spread Kindness**: Treat everyone with kindness and respect. This might seem small, but it's a big step towards creating a more peaceful world. When people feel valued and respected, they're less likely to want to hurt others.

3. **Share Your Ideas**: Talk to your family, friends, and teachers about your desire for peace. You can also write letters or draw pictures about peace and share them with others. You never know who might be inspired by your words or art!

4. **Help in Your Community**: Look for ways to help in your local community. This could be anything from helping with community clean-up projects to volunteering at a local charity. Seeing the positive impact you can have on people's lives can inspire you to want to do more.

5. **Educate Others**: As you learn more about peace and conflict, share that knowledge with others. You can teach your friends about different cultures, or talk to your class about the importance of kindness and respect.

6. **Support Peace Organizations**: When you're older, you can support organizations that work for peace. This could be through donating money, volunteering your time, or raising awareness about their work.

7. **Be Patient and Persistent**: Change takes time, and it's important to be patient. Keep working towards your goals, even if you don't see immediate results.

8. **Take Care of Yourself**: It's

Q5_51_ I am 6 years old and from France. I know not at all about Citizens’ dialogue, EU Youth Dialogue or EU Youth Conference. Can you tell me more about this? I am very curious to know more about this.

Dear friend,

I'm delighted to help you understand these important topics! Let's imagine we're having a conversation, and I'll explain them in a simple and fun way.

1. **Citizens' Dialogue**: Imagine you're in a big park with your friends, and you all want to decide how to use the park's sandbox. Some of you want to play with sandcastles, others want to make a big sandpit for games like tag, and some want to use it for planting flowers. So, you all sit down, listen to each other's ideas, and talk about what you think would be the best use of the sandbox. That's similar to a Citizens' Dialogue!

In the real world, a Citizens' Dialogue is an event organized by the European Union (EU) where people from different countries and backgrounds come together to talk about important topics. They share their thoughts, ideas, and concerns, and try to find solutions together. It's like a big conversation where everyone's voice is heard.

2. **EU Youth Dialogue**: Now, imagine you're in a school where only kids go, and you all want to make some changes to make your school even better. You have a special meeting where you talk about what you like and don't like about your school, and what you think could be improved. You listen to each other's ideas, and together, you come up with a plan to make your school even more awesome. That's similar to the EU Youth Dialogue!

The EU Youth Dialogue is a special conversation between young people from all over Europe and the EU institutions. It's a way for young people to share their ideas, concerns, and hopes about the future. They talk about things like education, jobs, and how to make the world a better place. The EU listens to what young people have to say and tries to make changes based on their ideas.

Q5_52_ I am 6 years old and from France. I know not at all about Public consultations. Can you tell me more about this? I am very curious.

Hello! It's wonderful to hear that you're curious about public consultations. I'll explain it in a simple way so that you can understand.

A public consultation is like a big conversation between people and the people who make important decisions in a country or a city. It's a way for everyone to have a say in what happens in their community.

Imagine you're in a classroom, and the teacher wants to decide on a new game for recess. The teacher could just choose a game on their own, but that might not be fair because some kids might not like that game. So, the teacher asks everyone in the class what games they like, and then they all talk about it together. That's a bit like a public consultation!

In a public consultation, grown-ups who work for the government or a big organization ask people what they think about something important. For example, they might want to know if people like the idea of building a new park in their neighborhood, or if they think it's a good idea to have more recycling bins in the city.

People can share their thoughts and ideas by filling out a special form, or by coming to a meeting to talk about it with other people. Sometimes, they can even vote on what they think is the best idea.

The people who organize the public consultation listen to what everyone has to say, and then they use that information to help them make a decision. This way, everyone has a chance to be heard, and the decision is more likely to be fair and helpful for the community.

So, public consultations are a way for people to work together and make sure that everyone's voice is heard when important decisions are being made. It's a great way to learn about what's happening in your community and to have a say in what happens next!
Q5_53_ I am 6 years old and from France. I know kind of about European elections. Can you tell me more about this? What is it? What do they do? Why are they important?

Hello! It's wonderful to hear that you're interested in learning about European elections. I'll do my best to explain them in a way that's easy for you to understand.

1. **What are European elections?**
European elections are like a big vote where people from many different countries in Europe get to choose who will represent them in the European Parliament. The European Parliament is like a big group of people who make decisions for the European Union (EU), which is like a big club of countries that work together.

2. **What does the European Parliament do?**
The European Parliament has several important jobs. They:
   - Make and change laws for the EU, along with the Council of the EU (which represents the governments of the member countries).
   - Decide on the EU's budget, which is like a big piggy bank that pays for things like roads, schools, and environmental projects.
   - Check if the European Commission (which is like the EU's government) is doing its job properly.
   - Help to make sure that the rights of EU citizens are protected.

3. **Why are European elections important?**
European elections are important for several reasons:
   - **Choosing who represents you**: By voting, you get to choose who will speak up for you and your country in the European Parliament. These people are called Members of the European Parliament, or MEPs for short.
   - **Shaping EU laws**: The MEPs you vote for will help make decisions about new laws and rules for the EU. These laws can affect many aspects of our lives, like how we travel, what we eat, and how we protect the environment.
   - **Making sure your voice is heard**: European elections give you a chance to have your say about how the EU should work. Even if you're too young to vote, it's important to learn about these elections and talk to your family
Q5_54_ I am 6 years old and from France. I know not at all about EU social media channels and websites (i.e. European Youth Portal). Can you tell me more about this? Thank you.

The European Youth Portal is a website created by the European Commission to provide information and resources for young people in Europe. It covers a wide range of topics, including education, employment, volunteering, and mobility opportunities. The portal also offers a space for young people to share their ideas and experiences, and to connect with each other.

As for EU social media channels, the European Union has a presence on several popular platforms, including:

* Facebook: The EU's official Facebook page provides news, updates, and multimedia content related to EU policies and activities. It also features a section dedicated to young people, called "EU4Youth."
* Twitter: The EU's official Twitter account (@EU_Commission) shares news and information about EU policies and initiatives. There are also several other EU Twitter accounts focused on specific topics, such as @EU_Young and @EU_Research.
* Instagram: The EU's official Instagram account (@europeanunion) showcases photos and videos related to EU policies, initiatives, and events. It also features a section dedicated to young people, called "EU4Youth."
* YouTube: The EU's official YouTube channel features videos about EU policies, initiatives, and events. It also includes a playlist dedicated to young people, called "EU4Youth."
* LinkedIn: The EU's official LinkedIn page provides news and updates about EU policies and initiatives related to employment, education, and research.

These social media channels and the European Youth Portal are all designed to help young people engage with the EU and stay informed about opportunities and initiatives that may be relevant to them. Even though you are only 6 years old, it's great that you are already interested in learning about the EU! As you grow older, you may find these resources helpful in staying connected with the EU and understanding how it affects your life.

Q5_57_ I am 6 years old and from France. I know not at all about Contacting a Commissioner or an MEP. Can you tell me more about this? I would like to know how to contact them and what I can say to them.

Dear friend,

It's wonderful that you're interested in contacting a Commissioner or a Member of the European Parliament (MEP)! They are important people who help make decisions for the European Union, which is like a big club that includes many countries, including France.

Here's how you can contact them and what you might say:

1. **Finding a Commissioner or MEP:**
   - **Commissioners:** The European Commission has 27 commissioners, one from each EU country. You can find them on the European Commission's website. They each have a specific area they look after, like environment, economy, or education. You can choose one whose area you're interested in.
   - **MEPs:** MEPs are elected by the people in their country to represent them in the European Parliament. You can find your local MEP on the European Parliament's website. They also have specific areas they focus on.

2. **Contacting them:**
   - **Email:** Most commissioners and MEPs have an email address where you can send them a message. You can usually find this on their official website.
   - **Post:** You can also write them a letter. You can find their postal address on their official website.
   - **Social Media:** Some commissioners and MEPs are active on social media platforms like Twitter. You can send them a message there, but remember to be polite and respectful.

3. **What to say:**
   - **Introduce yourself:** Start by telling them a little bit about yourself. You can say that you're 6 years old and from France.
   - **Tell them what you're interested in:** Let them know what you're interested in. It could be something you've learned at school, or something you like to do, like playing sports or reading books.

Q5_58_ I am 6 years old and from France. I know not at all about Participation in events organised by the EU in your country. Can you tell me more about this?
Q5_59_ I am 6 years old and from France. I know not at all about European Citizens’ Initiative. Can you tell me more about this? I would like to know what it is, how it works, and how I can participate.

Hello! It's wonderful to hear that you're interested in learning about the European Citizens’ Initiative (ECI). I'll do my best to explain it in a way that's easy for you to understand.

1. **What is the European Citizens’ Initiative?**
The European Citizens’ Initiative is like a special way for people in the European Union (EU) to tell the European Commission (which is like the government of the EU) what they think is important. It's a way for citizens to have a direct say in how the EU works.

2. **How does it work?**
To start an ECI, a group of at least one million EU citizens from at least seven different EU countries needs to come together and agree on a topic they want to change or improve. They then write a proposal and collect signatures from other EU citizens to support their idea. If they get enough signatures (at least one million), the European Commission has to look at their proposal and decide what to do about it.

Here's a simple breakdown:
- Find a topic you care about (like protecting animals, cleaning the environment, or making sure everyone has enough food).
- Gather a group of friends, family, or other people who care about the same topic.
- Write a proposal about what you want to change or improve.
- Collect signatures from other EU citizens who support your idea. You need at least one million signatures from at least seven different EU countries.

3. **How can you participate?**
Since you're 6 years old, you might not be able to start an ECI yourself, but you can still help and participate in other ways:

- **Talk to your family and friends**: Share your ideas and thoughts about what you think is important. They might want to support your ideas or start an ECI of their own.
- **Learn more about the EU**: The more you
