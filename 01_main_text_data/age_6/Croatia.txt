Q4b_41_ I am 6 years old and from Croatia. I am a little interested in changing society in the area of Climate change and environmental protection. Can you tell me how I can do this? I want to do something good for the planet.

Hello! It's wonderful to hear that you're already thinking about how to make a positive impact on our planet at such a young age. Here are some simple and fun ways you can help protect the environment and raise awareness about climate change:

1. **Learn More**: Start by learning more about climate change and environmental issues. You can ask your parents or teachers to help you find age-appropriate books, videos, or websites that explain these topics in a simple and engaging way.

2. **Plant Trees**: Trees absorb carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change. You can help by planting trees in your backyard, school, or a local park. You can also participate in community tree-planting events.

3. **Reduce, Reuse, Recycle**: Help your family and school reduce waste by recycling paper, plastic, and metal. You can also encourage them to reuse and repurpose items instead of throwing them away. For example, old clothes can be turned into rags for cleaning, or plastic containers can be used to store food.

4. **Save Water and Energy**: Turn off lights and electronics when you're not using them. You can also help save water by turning off the tap while brushing your teeth or washing your hands. Remember, every drop counts!

5. **Use Reusable Bags**: Instead of using plastic bags for shopping, ask your parents to use reusable bags. You can even decorate your own reusable bags to make them more fun!

6. **Eat More Plants**: Livestock farming contributes to greenhouse gas emissions. By eating more fruits, vegetables, and grains, you can help reduce your carbon footprint. Plus, a plant-based diet is healthier too!

7. **Spread Awareness**: Talk to your friends, family, and teachers about what you've learned about climate change and how they can help. You can also create posters or give presentations at school to raise awareness.

Q5_51_ I am 6 years old and from Croatia. I know not at all about Citizens’ dialogue, EU Youth Dialogue or EU Youth Conference. Can you tell me more about this? I am very curious.

Dear friend,

I'm glad you're curious about these topics! Let's imagine you're in a big school called Europe, where many countries come together to learn and play. The European Union (EU) is like the teachers and helpers in this school, making sure everyone gets along, learns, and has fun.

1. **Citizens' Dialogue**: Imagine you're in a classroom, and the teacher wants to know what you think about a new game they want to introduce. So, they organize a discussion where everyone can share their ideas, ask questions, and give feedback. That's similar to a Citizens' Dialogue! It's a way for EU leaders to talk to people like you and your family about what they think is important and how the EU can help make things better. They happen in different countries, and sometimes even online.

2. **EU Youth Dialogue**: Now, imagine there's a special club in your school just for kids your age. This club wants to know what you think about things that matter to you, like games you like to play, books you like to read, or how to make recess more fun. The EU Youth Dialogue is like this club, but for the whole of Europe! It's a way for young people like you to share your ideas and opinions with EU leaders about things that are important to you, like education, jobs, or the environment. They organize events and online discussions where you can join in and have your say.

3. **EU Youth Conference**: Finally, think of a big school event where kids from all the different classes come together to share what they've been working on and learn from each other. The EU Youth Conference is like this event! It's a chance for young people from all over Europe to meet, talk about the things they care about, and come up with ideas together.

Q5_52_ I am 6 years old and from Croatia. I know not at all about Public consultations. Can you tell me more about this? I am very curious.

Hello! It's wonderful to hear that you're curious about public consultations. I'll explain it in a simple way so that you can understand.

Imagine you're in your classroom, and your teacher wants to make some changes, like moving the desks or adding new games to the playground. Before making these changes, your teacher might ask you and your classmates what you think about the ideas. This is similar to a public consultation.

A public consultation is when grown-ups, like people who work for the government or big organizations, ask other people (like you and your neighbors) for their opinions and ideas about something they want to do or change. This could be about building a new park, changing some rules, or even planning a big event in your city.

Here's why public consultations are important:

1. **Your voice matters**: By sharing your thoughts and ideas, you can help make decisions that affect you and your community. This is called having a say in what happens.

2. **It helps others understand what you like and don't like**: When you share your opinions, others can learn more about what you think is important or not so good. This helps them make better choices.

3. **It's a chance to learn**: Public consultations can teach you about different topics and help you understand how things work in your community.

So, even though you might not have heard about public consultations before, you've probably experienced something similar in your classroom or at home. It's all about sharing your thoughts and ideas to help make things better! Keep being curious, and don't forget to speak up when you have something to say.
Q5_53_ I am 6 years old and from Croatia. I know kind of about European elections. Can you tell me more about this? What are they and why are they important?

Dear friend,

I'm delighted to help you understand the European elections! Let's imagine you're playing a game with your friends at school. In this game, you all want to decide who will be the captain of your team. So, you have an election where everyone gets to vote for their favorite candidate. The person who gets the most votes becomes the captain.

European elections are similar, but on a much larger scale. They are like a big game where all the countries in the European Union (EU) get to vote for who will represent them in the European Parliament. The European Parliament is like the captain of the EU team, making important decisions that affect all the countries in the EU.

Here are some reasons why European elections are important:

1. **Choosing who represents you**: Just like in your school game, European elections give you a chance to choose who will represent you and your country in the European Parliament. These representatives, called Members of the European Parliament (MEPs), will make decisions that can affect your life, like rules about the environment, your rights, and even what kind of food you can eat.

2. **Shaping Europe's future**: The European Parliament has a big say in how the EU is run. It helps make laws, decides how money is spent, and chooses the President of the European Commission, which is like the manager of the EU team. So, by voting in European elections, you're helping to shape the future of Europe.

3. **Making your voice heard**: European elections are a chance for you to have your say about how things are done in the EU. By voting, you're showing that you care about what happens in Europe and that you want to be part of the decision-making process.

4. **Learning about democracy**: Participating in European elections is a great way to learn about democracy. It teaches you about the importance of voting, having a say in how things are run,
