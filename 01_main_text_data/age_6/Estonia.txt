Hello! It's wonderful to hear that you're already thinking about how to make a positive impact on the world at such a young age. Here are some simple and age-appropriate ways you can help make a difference in the area of climate change and environmental protection:

1. **Learn More**: Start by learning more about climate change and environmental issues. You can ask your parents or teachers to help you find age-appropriate books, videos, or websites that explain these topics in a way that's easy to understand.

2. **Reduce, Reuse, Recycle**: This is a great way to start making a difference. Here's how you can do it:
   - **Reduce**: Try to use less. For example, turn off lights when you leave a room, or ask your parents to help you turn off electronic devices when they're not in use.

   - **Recycle**: Help your family sort out recyclable materials like paper, plastic, and metal. Ask your parents to show you how to do this.

3. **Plant Trees**: Trees absorb carbon dioxide from the air, which helps to reduce the effects of climate change. You could ask your parents to help you plant a tree in your garden or a local park.

4. **Save Water**: Turn off the tap when you're brushing your teeth or washing your hands. This can help save water and reduce the amount of energy needed to treat and pump water.

5. **Save Energy**: Turn off lights and electronics when you're not using them. You could also ask your parents to help you switch to energy-saving light bulbs.

Q5_53_ I am 6 years old and from Estonia. I know kind of about European elections. Can you tell me more about this? What is it? What do they do? Why are they important?

Dear friend,

I'm delighted to help you understand the European elections! Let's imagine you're in a big school called Europe, where many countries come together to learn and play. The European Union (EU) is like the school's council, made up of representatives from each country to make decisions that affect everyone.

1. **What are the European elections?**
   The European elections are like a big vote where people from the EU countries choose who will represent them in the European Parliament. This parliament is like the student council of our big European school. It has 705 members, called Members of the European Parliament (MEPs), who come from all the EU countries.

2. **What do the MEPs do?**
   MEPs have several important jobs:
   - **Making laws**: They work together with the Council of the EU (which represents the governments of the member countries) to make new laws that apply to all EU countries. These laws can be about many things, like protecting the environment, ensuring safety in the workplace, or making sure food is labeled correctly.
   - **Controlling the EU budget**: MEPs decide how the EU's money should be spent. They make sure that the money is used fairly and wisely.
   - **Supervising the European Commission**: The European Commission is like the EU's government, and MEPs keep an eye on what they do to make sure they're working in the best interests of EU citizens.

3. **Why are the European elections important?**
   The European elections are important for several reasons:
   - **Choosing who represents you**: By voting, you get to choose who will speak up for you and your country in the European Parliament. It's your chance to have a say in how the EU is run.
   - **Shaping the future of Europe**: The MEPs you elect will help make decisions that affect your life

Q5_55_ I am 6 years old and from Estonia. I know not at all about Visit of the EU institutions. Can you tell me more about this? What is the EU? What are the EU institutions? What is the Visit of the EU institutions?

The EU, or European Union, is a group of 27 countries that work together to make rules and laws that affect how they trade with each other and how their citizens can travel, work, and live in other EU countries. The EU has several institutions that help it make decisions and carry out its work. Here are the main ones:

1. **European Parliament**: This is like the parliament of the EU. It's made up of members who are elected by the people of the EU countries. They make laws and decide how EU money is spent.

2. **European Council**: This is where the leaders of the EU countries meet to discuss and decide on important issues. The President of the European Council chairs these meetings.

3. **Council of the European Union**: This is where ministers from the EU countries meet to discuss and decide on specific policy areas, like agriculture or justice.

4. **European Commission**: This is like the government of the EU. It proposes new laws, makes sure EU countries follow the rules, and manages the EU's budget.

5. **European Court of Justice**: This court makes sure that EU law is followed correctly.

The "Visit of the EU institutions" could refer to a few things:

Dear friend,

I'm glad you're interested in learning about the European Youth Week and the European Youth Event! I'll explain them in a simple way, and I'll also tell you how you can participate and what you can learn from these events.

1. **What is the European Youth Week?**
The European Youth Week is a week-long celebration that happens every year in May. It's like a big birthday party for young people like you, who live in Europe or are interested in Europe. During this week, many fun and interesting activities take place in different countries. These activities are organized by young people themselves, with the help of youth organizations and local authorities. The goal is to give young people a chance to express their ideas, share their experiences, and learn from each other.

2. **What is the European Youth Event (EYE)?**
The European Youth Event is a bigger event that happens every two years in the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France. It's like a big meeting where young people from all over Europe come together to discuss important topics, like the environment, education, and how to make Europe a better place.

The EYE is a great opportunity for young people to have their voices heard and to learn about how the EU works.

3. **How can I participate?**

Q5_57_ I am 6 years old and from Estonia. I know not at all about Contacting a Commissioner or an MEP. Can you tell me more about this? I would like to know how to contact them and what I can ask them.

Dear friend,

It's wonderful that you're interested in learning about how to contact a Commissioner or a Member of the European Parliament (MEP). Here's a simple guide to help you understand how to do this and what you might want to ask them.

1. **Who are they?**
   - **Commissioners**: They are the members of the European Commission, which is the executive branch of the European Union (EU). They are responsible for proposing new laws and policies for the EU. There are 27 Commissioners, one from each EU country.
   - **MEPs**: They are the members of the European Parliament, which is the legislative branch of the EU. They are elected by EU citizens to represent their interests and pass EU laws.

2. **How to contact them?**
   - **Commissioners**: You can find the contact details of each Commissioner on the European Commission's website. Here's the link: [https://ec.europa.eu/commission/commissioners_en](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/commissioners_en). You can send them an email or a letter. If you're writing in Estonian, they might not understand it, so it's best to write in English.
   - **MEPs**: You can find the contact details of MEPs on the European Parliament's website. Here's the link: [https://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/home](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/home). MEPs have offices in their home countries, so you can contact the one from Estonia. Again, it's best to write in English.

3. **What can you ask them?**

Q5_59_ I am 6 years old and from Estonia. I know not at all about European Citizens’ Initiative. Can you tell me more about this? What is it?

A European Citizens’ Initiative (ECI) is a way for citizens of the European Union (EU) to directly influence the EU’s decision-making process. It allows you to propose a new law or change an existing one. Here’s a simple breakdown for you:

1. **Who can start an ECI?**
   - You need to be a citizen of an EU country.
   - You need to be at least 18 years old.
   - You need to be a resident of the EU for at least 12 months before starting the initiative.

2. **What can you propose?**
   - You can propose a new EU law or change an existing one.
   - It must fall within the EU’s competences (things the EU can make laws about, like environment, energy, or consumer protection).
   - It must respect the EU’s values and treaties.

3. **How many people need to support it?**
   - You need to gather at least one million signatures from EU citizens.
   - These signatures must come from at least seven different EU countries.
   - Each country has a minimum number of signatures required, based on its population.

4. **What happens if you gather enough signatures?**
   - The European Commission will examine your proposal.
   - If it’s relevant for EU law and falls within the EU’s competences, the Commission will decide whether to propose a legislative act based on your initiative.

5. **Can I help with an ECI?**
   - Yes, you can! Even though you’re too young to start or sign an ECI yourself, you can help spread the word about initiatives you care about. You can talk to your parents, teachers, or other adults about them.

Here are some simple steps to remember:

- ECIs are a way for EU citizens to propose new laws or change existing ones.
- You need to be an EU citizen, at least 18 years old
