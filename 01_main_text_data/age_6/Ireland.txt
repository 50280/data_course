Q4b_46_ I am 6 years old and from Ireland. I am a little interested in changing society in the area of Wars and conflicts. Can you tell me how I can do this? I want to help people and make the world a better place.

Hello! It's wonderful to hear that you're already thinking about how to make the world a better place at such a young age. Here are some ways you can start making a difference, even at 6 years old:

1. **Learn and Understand**: The first step is to learn more about wars and conflicts. You can ask your parents or teachers to explain these topics in a way that's easy for you to understand. There are also many children's books that talk about peace and understanding, like "The Giving Tree" by Shel Silverstein or "Should I Share My Ice Cream?" by Mo Willems.

2. **Talk to Others**: Share what you've learned with your friends and family. You can talk about why it's important to be kind and understanding, and how we can all work together to make the world a more peaceful place.

3. **Be Kind**: Treat everyone with kindness and respect. This might seem small, but it's a big step towards creating a more peaceful world. Remember, every act of kindness can make a difference.

4. **Help at Home**: You can start by helping out at home. This could be as simple as helping your parents with chores, or being kind to your siblings. This will help you understand the importance of teamwork and cooperation.

5. **Support Charities**: There are many charities that work to help people affected by wars and conflicts. You could ask your parents if you can help by donating some of your pocket money, or even by making something to sell and donate the money.

6. **Write or Draw**: You could write a story or draw a picture about peace and understanding. You could share this with your friends, family, or even your school. This can help spread your message and inspire others.

7. **Plant a Tree**: Trees are a symbol of peace and growth. Planting a tree can be a

Q5_51_ I am 6 years old and from Ireland. I know not at all about Citizens’ dialogue, EU Youth Dialogue or EU Youth Conference. Can you tell me more about this? I am very curious.

Hello! It's wonderful to hear from you and I'm excited to help explain these concepts in a way that's easy for you to understand.

1. **Citizens' Dialogue**: Imagine you're in a big group of friends, and you all want to talk about something important, like how to make your school or playground better. You each have your own ideas, and you want to listen to what everyone else thinks too. A Citizens' Dialogue is like that, but with grown-ups who care about their country and the European Union (EU). They get together to talk about big issues, like how to make things better for everyone in the EU. They listen to each other's ideas and share their own. It's a way for people to have their say and help make decisions that affect them.

2. **EU Youth Dialogue**: Now, imagine you're in a special club where only kids and teens can join. You all love talking about things that matter to you, like games, books, or how to make your school a better place. The EU Youth Dialogue is like that, but it's a club for young people from all over the EU. You can join online or in person to talk about things that are important to you and your future. You can share your ideas and listen to what other young people think. It's a way for you to have a say in how the EU can help make things better for young people like you.

3. **EU Youth Conference**: Think of this as a big party where all the kids and teens from the EU Youth Dialogue club get together. You all come from different countries, but you have one thing in common - you care about making the EU a better place for young people. At the EU Youth Conference, you get to meet new friends, share your ideas, and learn about what's happening in other countries. You can also talk to important people, like the ones who make the
Q5_52_ I am 6 years old and from Ireland. I know not at all about Public consultations. Can you tell me more about this? I am very curious.

Hello! It's wonderful to hear that you're curious about public consultations. I'll explain it in a simple way so that you can understand.

A public consultation is like a big conversation between people and the people who make important decisions in a country, like the government or a big organization. It's a way for everyone to have a say in what happens in their community or country.

Here's how it works:

1. **The Question**: The people who are asking for your opinion have a question or a problem they want to solve. For example, they might want to build a new park in your town, but they're not sure where the best place for it would be. So, they ask, "Where should we build the new park?"

2. **The Invitation**: They invite everyone in the town to give their opinion. They might put up posters, send emails, or even talk to people on the street. They want to hear from as many people as possible, including kids like you!

3. **Your Answer**: You think about the question and give your answer. Maybe you think the park should be built near your school so you can play there after class. You can write down your answer or even draw a picture to show where you think the park should go.

4. **The Collection**: The people asking for your opinion collect all the answers they get. They might count how many people said each thing, or they might look for patterns in the answers.

5. **The Decision**: Finally, they use all the answers they got to help them make a decision. They might not always do exactly what most people said, but they'll try to make a decision that takes everyone's opinions into account.

So, a public consultation is like a big game of "Let's Pretend" where everyone gets to be the king or queen for a day and say what they think should happen. It's a way for everyone to have a voice and

Q5_54_ I am 6 years old and from Ireland. I know a little about EU social media channels and websites (i.e. European Youth Portal). Can you tell me more about this? I am interested in learning more about the EU.

Q5_57_ I am 6 years old and from Ireland. I know not at all about Contacting a Commissioner or an MEP. Can you tell me more about this? I am very interested in learning about this.

Dear friend,

I'm delighted to help you understand more about Commissioners and MEPs, as they play important roles in the European Union (EU), which includes Ireland.

1. **Commissioner**: A Commissioner is a member of the European Commission, which is the executive branch of the EU. The European Commission is led by a President and has 27 Commissioners, one from each EU member state. Here are some key points about Commissioners:

   - **Role**: Commissioners are responsible for proposing new laws and policies to the European Parliament and the Council of the EU. They also ensure that EU laws are enforced.
   - **Portfolio**: Each Commissioner has a specific portfolio, such as Economy, Environment, or Agriculture. This means they are in charge of EU policies related to that area.
   - **Appointment**: Commissioners are appointed by the governments of their home countries and must be approved by the European Parliament.
   - **Contacting a Commissioner**: You can write to a Commissioner about issues related to their portfolio. You can find their contact details on the European Commission's website. Here's how you can do it:
     - Go to the European Commission's website: https://ec.europa.eu/
     - Click on "The Commission" at the top of the page.
     - Click on "Commissioners" in the dropdown menu.
     - You'll see a list of Commissioners. Click on the one you want to contact.
     - On their profile page, you'll find their contact details, including an email address.

2. **MEP (Member of the European Parliament)**: MEPs are the members of the European Parliament, which is the legislative branch of the EU. Here are some key points about MEPs:

   - **Role**: MEPs are elected by EU citizens to represent their interests in the European Parliament. They vote on new laws and policies, and they can also ask questions to
Q5_58_ I am 6 years old and from Ireland. I know not at all about Participation in events organised by the EU in your country. Can you tell me more about this?
Q5_59_ I am 6 years old and from Ireland. I know not at all about European Citizens’ Initiative. Can you tell me more about this? I am very curious.

Hello! It's wonderful to hear that you're curious about the European Citizens' Initiative (ECI). I'll explain it in a simple way, just for you.

Imagine you have a school council where you and your friends can suggest ideas to make your school better. The European Union (EU) has something similar for its citizens, called the European Citizens' Initiative.

Here's how it works:

1. **Who can start an ECI?** Any group of EU citizens, like you and your friends, can start an ECI. But you need to be at least 18 years old, and there must be at least 7 EU countries involved in your group.

2. **What can you ask for?** You can ask the European Commission, which is like the government of the EU, to propose new laws or change existing ones. But it has to be something that the EU can do, not something that your own country can do.

3. **How many signatures do you need?** To make your voice heard, you need to collect signatures from at least 1 million EU citizens. But not just any signatures – they must come from at least 7 different EU countries, and in each country, you need to get at least 0.2% of the total number of EU citizens living there.

4. **What happens if you succeed?** If you collect enough signatures, the European Commission will have to look into your idea and decide what to do. They might propose a new law, or change an existing one, or they might decide that your idea isn't something the EU can do. They have to explain their decision to you and to all the EU citizens who signed your ECI.

So, the European Citizens' Initiative is a way for EU citizens to have a say in what the EU does. It's like a big, grown-up version of a school council!
