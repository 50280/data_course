Dear friend,

It's wonderful that you're interested in democratic participation at such a young age! Here are some ways you can get involved and make your voice heard:

2. **Community Events**: Participate in local community events. This could be anything from a neighborhood clean-up to a local festival. These events often welcome input from everyone, including kids.

3. **Write Letters**: You can write letters to your local mayor, council members, or even the prime minister about issues that matter to you. They have a duty to respond to your concerns.

4. **Join a Club or Group**: There might be clubs or groups in your community that focus on issues you care about, like protecting the environment or helping animals. Joining these can give you a chance to participate in decision-making processes.

5. **Youth Parliaments**: Some countries have youth parliaments where young people can learn about democracy and have a say in decisions that affect them. You can check if there's one in your country.

6. **Family Meetings**: Start by practicing democracy at home. You could have family meetings where everyone gets a say in decisions.

7. **Learn About Democracy**: The more you understand about democracy, the better you'll be able to participate. You can read books, watch videos, or talk to your teachers and parents about it.

8. **Vote**: When you're old enough, make sure to vote in elections. Your vote is your voice, and it's important!

Q5_51_ I am 6 years old and from Hungary. I know not at all about Citizens’ dialogue, EU Youth Dialogue or EU Youth Conference. Can you tell me more about this? I am very curious.

Dear friend,

I'm glad you're curious about these topics! Let's imagine you're in a big playground called Europe, where many children from different countries come to play together. This playground has some special rules and activities that make it fun for everyone.

1. **Citizens' Dialogue**: Imagine you're playing with your friends, and sometimes you have disagreements about how to play a game or share toys. To solve these issues, you all sit down and talk about your ideas and feelings. You listen to each other and try to find a solution that makes everyone happy. That's similar to a Citizens' Dialogue. In this case, grown-ups from different European countries get together to talk about important topics, like how to make the playground (Europe) a better place for everyone. They share their ideas and listen to each other, just like you and your friends do when you play together.

2. **EU Youth Dialogue**: Now, imagine there's a special club in the playground where only children can go. In this club, you can talk about things that are important to you, like how to make the playground more fun, or how to help other children who might be feeling left out. The grown-ups listen to what you have to say and try to help you make changes. The EU Youth Dialogue is like this club. It's a place where young people from all over Europe can come together to talk about issues that matter to them, like education, jobs, or the environment. They share their ideas and suggestions with the grown-ups, who then try to make these ideas a reality.

3. **EU Youth Conference**: Finally, imagine that once a year, the playground organizes a big party where all the children can come together to celebrate and talk about the things they've achieved throughout the year. They can also share new ideas and plans for the future. The EU Youth Conference is like this party. It's an annual event where young
Q5_52_ I am 6 years old and from Hungary. I know not at all about Public consultations. Can you tell me more about this? I am very curious.

Hello! It's wonderful to hear that you're curious about public consultations. I'll explain it in a simple way so that you can understand.

A public consultation is like a big conversation between people and the people who make rules or decisions for a city, country, or even the whole world. It's a way for everyone to have a say in what happens in their community or the world.

Imagine you're in a classroom, and the teacher wants to decide on a new game for recess. The teacher could just pick a game on their own, but that might not be fair because some kids might not like that game. So, the teacher asks everyone in the class what games they like, and then they all talk about it together. That's a bit like a public consultation!

In a public consultation, grown-ups who make decisions (like politicians, or people who work for the government) ask everyone in the community what they think about a certain topic. They might ask questions like:

- Should we build a new park in our neighborhood?
- What do you think about having more recycling bins in our city?
- Should we change the rules for playing in the playground?

Everyone can share their ideas and opinions, and the people who make decisions will listen and think about what they've heard. This helps them make better choices because they've taken into account what the community wants and needs.

Public consultations can happen in many ways. Sometimes, people can fill out a form or write a letter to share their thoughts. Other times, there might be a big meeting where everyone can talk and listen to each other. Some consultations even happen online, so people can share their ideas from home.

So, a public consultation is like a big, important conversation where everyone can have a say in what happens in their community. It's a way for people to work together and make decisions that are fair and good for everyone.

Q5_54_ I am 6 years old and from Hungary. I know not at all about EU social media channels and websites (i.e. European Youth Portal). Can you tell me more about this? I am interested in this topic.

Dear friend,

It's wonderful to hear that you're interested in learning about the European Union (EU) and its social media channels and websites, even at such a young age! I'll do my best to explain these in a simple and fun way.

1. **European Union (EU)**: Imagine the EU as a big club of countries that work together to make life better for all the people who live there. This club includes countries like Germany, France, Italy, Spain, and many more, including Hungary, where you live. They share the same rules and help each other out.

2. **European Youth Portal (https://europa.eu/youth/)**: This is like a special playground for young people like you, created by the EU. Here, you can find lots of fun and interesting information about the EU, like how it works, what it does, and how it affects your daily life. You can also learn about opportunities for young people, like studying or working in another EU country, or participating in youth exchanges and projects.

3. **EU Social Media Channels**: The EU also has accounts on popular social media platforms, like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube. These are like big, virtual classrooms where people from all over the world can learn about the EU and its activities. Here's what you can find on each of them:

   - **Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/EUinmyregion)**: This is like a big online party where people can share and discuss news, photos, and videos about the EU. You can find interesting stories about people and projects that are supported by the EU.

   - **Instagram (https://www.instagram.com/europeanunion/)**: Instagram is all about pictures and short videos. The EU's Instagram account shares beautiful photos and short clips about life in the EU, like people working together, enjoying nature, or celebrating cultural events.

Q5_55_ I am 6 years old and from Hungary. I know not at all about Visit of the EU institutions. Can you tell me more about this? Thank you.

Hello! It's wonderful to hear from you. I'm here to help explain the Visit of the EU institutions in a simple and fun way.

The EU, or European Union, is like a big club of countries that work together. They have some special places where important decisions are made, and these places are called EU institutions. Imagine you're in a big school, and these institutions are like the principal's office, the library, and the classroom where all the students meet.

1. **The European Parliament**: This is like the classroom where all the students (or in this case, the representatives from each EU country) meet to talk about rules and ideas. They vote on important things, like what kind of ice cream should be the official EU flavor (just kidding, but they do make important decisions!).

2. **The European Commission**: This is like the principal's office. They make sure everyone follows the rules and helps the EU work smoothly. They also come up with new ideas and plans for the EU.

3. **The Council of the European Union**: This is like a meeting room where the heads of each country's government (like the prime minister or president) get together to talk about big issues and make decisions.

4. **The Court of Justice of the European Union**: This is like a courtroom where any arguments or disagreements between countries, companies, or people are sorted out.

Now, when we talk about the "Visit of the EU institutions," it means going to these special places to learn more about how the EU works. You can see where important decisions are made, meet people who work there, and maybe even ask them questions. It's like going on a field trip to learn about how the EU helps countries work together!

Does that help explain it? If you have any more questions, just let me know! I'm here to help. 😊🌍

Q5_59_ I am 6 years old and from Hungary. I know not at all about European Citizens’ Initiative. Can you tell me more about this? I would like to know what it is, how it works and how I can participate in it.

Dear friend,

I'm delighted to help you understand the European Citizens' Initiative (ECI) in a simple and fun way!

1. **What is the European Citizens' Initiative?**
Imagine you have a great idea that you think could make Europe a better place. The ECI is like a big suggestion box for the European Union (EU). It's a way for citizens like you to tell the EU about your ideas and ask them to make new laws or change existing ones.

2. **How does it work?**
To start an ECI, you need to gather support from at least one million EU citizens from at least seven different EU countries. Here's a step-by-step guide:

   - **Come up with an idea**: This could be about anything that the EU can help with, like protecting the environment, improving education, or making sure everyone has enough food.

   - **Write a proposal**: You'll need to explain your idea clearly and say why it's important. You'll also need to show how the EU can help make it happen.

   - **Gather support**: You'll need to collect signatures from at least one million EU citizens. You can do this online or by using a paper form. The signatures need to come from at least seven different EU countries.

   - **Hand in your proposal**: Once you have enough signatures, you'll hand in your proposal to the European Commission. They'll check if your idea is something they can help with.

   - **The European Commission decides**: If your idea is something the EU can help with, the European Commission will decide if they want to make a new law or change an existing one. They'll tell you and everyone who supported your idea what they've decided.

3. **How can you participate?**
Even though you're too young to start your own ECI, you can still help! Here's
