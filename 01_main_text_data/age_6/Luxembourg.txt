Q5_52_ I am 6 years old and from Luxembourg. I know a little about Public consultations. Can you tell me more about this? What is it?

A public consultation is a way for people to share their thoughts and ideas about something that is happening in their community or country. It's like a big conversation where everyone can have a say. Here are some simple steps to understand it better:

1. **Someone wants to do something**: This could be a government, a company, or even a school. They have an idea or a plan, like building a new park, changing a rule, or starting a new project.

2. **They want to hear what others think**: Before they go ahead with their plan, they want to know what people think about it. So, they invite everyone to share their opinions. This is called a public consultation.

3. **People share their thoughts**: Anyone can join the conversation. You can tell them what you think is good about the plan, what you think could be better, or if you have any other ideas. You can do this by filling out a form, writing a letter, or even talking to them at a special meeting.

4. **They listen and learn**: The people who are doing the consultation listen to what everyone has to say. They might change their plan based on what they've heard, or they might explain why they can't make certain changes.

5. **They tell everyone what happened**: After the consultation, they tell everyone what they heard and how they used that information. This is called a feedback report.

So, a public consultation is like a big, important conversation where everyone can have a say in what happens in their community. It's a way for people to work together and make decisions that are fair and helpful for everyone.

Q5_57_ I am 6 years old and from Luxembourg. I know not at all about Contacting a Commissioner or an MEP. Can you tell me more about this? I would like to know how to contact them and what I can ask them.

Dear friend,

It's wonderful that you're interested in learning about how to contact a Commissioner or a Member of the European Parliament (MEP). Here's a simple guide to help you understand how to do this and what you can ask them.

1. **Who are they?**
   - **Commissioners**: They are the members of the European Commission, which is the executive branch of the European Union (EU). They are responsible for proposing new laws and policies for the EU. There are 27 Commissioners, one from each EU country.
   - **MEPs**: They are the members of the European Parliament, which is the legislative branch of the EU. They are elected by EU citizens to represent their interests and pass EU laws.

2. **How to contact them?**
   - **Commissioners**: You can find the contact details of each Commissioner on the European Commission's website. Here's the link: [https://ec.europa.eu/commission/commissioners_en](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/commissioners_en). Click on the Commissioner you want to contact, and you'll find their email address and other contact details.
   - **MEPs**: You can find the contact details of MEPs on the European Parliament's website. Here's the link: [https://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/home](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/home). You can search for MEPs by name or country. Once you've found the MEP you want to contact, click on their name, and you'll find their contact details.

3. **What can you ask them?**
   - You can ask them about any topic that is related to the EU. Here are a few examples:
     - **Commissioners**: You can ask them about new laws or policies they are working on, or

Q5_59_ I am 6 years old and from Luxembourg. I know a little about European Citizens’ Initiative. Can you tell me more about this? What is it?

A European Citizens’ Initiative (ECI) is a way for citizens of the European Union (EU) to propose new laws to the European Commission. It’s like a petition, but it’s special because it can change the laws of the whole EU if enough people support it.

Here are some simple steps to understand how it works:

1. **Idea**: First, a group of citizens comes up with an idea for a new law or a change to an existing law. This idea should be about something that the EU can make laws about, like the environment, energy, or consumer protection.

2. **Support**: The group then needs to find at least one million EU citizens from at least seven different EU countries to support their idea. This is to show that many people care about the issue and want the EU to do something about it.

3. **Registration**: Once the group has collected the signatures, they register their ECI with the European Commission. The Commission checks if the idea is about something the EU can make laws about and if it follows the right rules.

4. **One Year**: The group then has one year to collect the rest of the signatures they need. If they get at least one million signatures from at least seven different EU countries within that time, the European Commission has to do one of two things:
   - If the idea is good and the Commission agrees with it, they can propose a new law to the European Parliament and the Council of the EU.
   - If the Commission doesn’t agree with the idea, they have to explain why in a public hearing with the organizers of the ECI.

5. **Decision**: After the Commission makes its proposal, the European Parliament and the Council of the EU decide whether to make the new law or not.

So, an ECI is a way for citizens like you and me to have a say in the laws that affect us and our future in Europe. It’s a way to show that
