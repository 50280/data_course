Hello! It's wonderful to hear that you're already thinking about how to make a positive impact on the environment at such a young age. Here are some simple and fun ways you can help protect the planet:

1. **Learn More**: Start by learning more about climate change and environmental issues. There are many children's books and educational resources available online that can help you understand these topics in an age-appropriate way.

2. **Plant Trees**: Trees absorb carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change. You can help by planting trees in your community or even in your backyard if you have one. You can also support organizations that plant trees around the world.

3. **Reduce, Reuse, Recycle**: This is a simple but powerful way to help the environment. Try to reduce the amount of waste you produce by using reusable items like water bottles and bags. Recycle paper, plastic, and metal when you can.

4. **Save Water and Energy**: Turn off lights and electronics when you're not using them. Take shorter showers to save water. You can also help by reminding your family to do the same.

5. **Protect Wildlife**: You can help protect animals and their habitats by not littering, reducing your use of plastic, and supporting organizations that protect wildlife.

6. **Educate Others**: Share what you've learned about climate change and environmental protection with your friends, family, and classmates. You can start a conversation, write a story, or even create a poster to raise awareness.

7. **Join a Club or Group**: Look for local environmental clubs or groups for kids your age. This can be a great way to meet new friends and make a difference together.

8. **Write to Leaders**: You can write letters or emails to your local leaders, telling them about the issues you care about and asking them to take action.

1. **Learn and Understand**: Start by learning more about health and well-being. You can ask your parents, teachers, or even doctors about different aspects of health. You can also read books or watch educational videos that are suitable for your age.

The money you raise could go towards a local hospital, a health charity, or a cause that supports health and well-being.

6. **Be Kind and Compassionate**: Always treat others with kindness and compassion. This is a key aspect of health and well-being that is often overlooked.

7. **Set Goals**: Start thinking about what you want to achieve when you grow up. You've already expressed an interest in becoming a doctor, which is a wonderful goal
Q4b_43_ I am 6 years old and from Romania. I am a little interested in changing society in the area of Economic inequality and welfare expenditure. Can you tell me how I can do this? I want to be a leader in this area.

Q5_51_ I am 6 years old and from Romania. I know not at all about Citizens’ dialogue, EU Youth Dialogue or EU Youth Conference. Can you tell me more about this? I am very curious to learn more about this.

Hello! It's wonderful to hear that you're interested in learning about these topics. I'll explain them in a simple and fun way, just for you!

1. **Citizens' Dialogue**: Imagine you're in a big playground, and all the kids from different schools and countries come together to play and talk. In this playground, everyone has a chance to share their ideas, ask questions, and listen to others. This is similar to a Citizens' Dialogue, but instead of kids, it's adults from different countries who come together to talk about important things that affect their lives, like how to make their cities cleaner, how to help people who are in need, or how to make sure everyone has enough food to eat. They share their ideas and listen to each other, just like you would do with your friends in the playground. The European Union (EU) organizes these dialogues to help people understand each other better and work together to solve problems.

2. **EU Youth Dialogue**: Now, imagine you're in a special club where only kids are allowed. In this club, you can talk about things that are important to you, like how to make your school better, how to help your friends who are feeling sad, or how to make sure everyone has a chance to play their favorite games. The EU Youth Dialogue is like this special club, but it's for young people from all over Europe. They talk about things that are important to them, like how to make schools better, how to help young people find jobs, or how to make sure everyone has a chance to have fun and learn new things. The EU listens to what young people have to say and tries to help make their ideas come true.

3. **EU Youth Conference**: Finally, imagine you're at a big party where kids from all over the world come to play games, sing songs, and share stories. At this party,
Q5_52_ I am 6 years old and from Romania. I know not at all about Public consultations. Can you tell me more about this? I am very curious.

Hello! It's wonderful to hear that you're curious about public consultations. I'll explain it in a simple way so that you can understand.

Imagine you're in your classroom, and your teacher wants to make some changes, like moving the desks or adding new books to the library. Before making these changes, your teacher might ask you and your classmates what you think about the ideas. This is similar to a public consultation.

A public consultation is when grown-ups, like people who work for the government or big organizations, ask other people (like you and your neighbors) for their opinions and ideas about something they want to do or change. This could be about rules in your city, new buildings, or even big projects that affect many people.

Here's why public consultations are important:

1. **Your voice matters**: By sharing your thoughts, you can help make decisions that affect you and your community.

2. **It helps grown-ups understand what you think**: They might have good ideas, but they want to know if you and other people like those ideas or if you have better ones.

3. **It's a chance to learn**: Public consultations can teach you about things happening in your community and how decisions are made.

So, even though you're just 6 years old, your opinions are important, and grown-ups want to hear what you think. If you ever have a chance to participate in a public consultation, don't be shy to share your ideas!
Q5_53_ I am 6 years old and from Romania. I know kind of about European elections. Can you tell me more about this? What are they and why are they important?

Dear friend,

I'm delighted to help you understand the European elections! Let's imagine you're playing a game with your friends at school. In this game, you all want to decide who will be the captain of your team. So, you have an election where everyone gets to vote for their favorite candidate. The person who gets the most votes becomes the captain.

European elections are similar, but on a much larger scale. They are like a big game where all the countries in the European Union (EU) get to vote for who will represent them in the European Parliament. The European Parliament is like the captain of the EU team, making important decisions that affect all the countries in the EU.

Here are some reasons why European elections are important:

1. **Choosing who represents you**: Just like in your school game, European elections give you a chance to choose who will represent you and your country in the European Parliament. These representatives, called Members of the European Parliament (MEPs), will make decisions that can affect your life, like rules about the environment, education, or even what kind of food you can eat.

2. **Shaping EU policies**: The European Parliament has the power to make and change laws that apply to all EU countries. These laws can affect many aspects of our daily lives, from the safety of the products we use to the quality of the air we breathe. By voting in the European elections, you're helping to decide who will shape these policies.

3. **Promoting democracy**: European elections are an important part of democracy. Democracy means that people have a say in how they are governed. By voting, you're exercising your right to have a voice in the decisions that affect you and your country.

4. **Choosing the European Commission President**: After the European elections, the European Council (which is made up of the heads of state or government of each EU country) proposes a candidate for the President of the
Q5_54_ I am 6 years old and from Romania. I know not at all about EU social media channels and websites (i.e. European Youth Portal). Can you tell me more about this? I am very curious to know about this.

Dear friend,

1. **European Union (EU) Social Media Channels:**

   - **Facebook:** The EU has official pages in many languages, including English, French, German, Spanish, and more. Here, they share news, events, and interesting facts about the EU. You can find them at:
     - EU in English: <https://www.facebook.com/EUinEnglish/>
     - EU in other languages: <https://www.facebook.com/EU-other-languages-100064281687750/>

   - **Twitter:** The EU uses Twitter to share updates, engage with people, and answer questions. You can follow them at:

Q5_55_ I am 6 years old and from Romania. I know not at all about Visit of the EU institutions. Can you tell me more about this? Thank you.

Hello! It's wonderful to hear from you. I'm here to help explain the Visit of the EU institutions in a simple and fun way.

The EU, or European Union, is like a big club of countries that work together. Some of the countries in this club are Germany, France, Italy, Spain, and even Romania, where you live!

The EU has some important places where the leaders of these countries meet and make decisions. These places are called institutions. There are three main ones:

1. **The European Parliament**: This is like a big meeting room where the leaders of the EU countries talk about important things. They discuss rules for the countries in the EU, like how to keep the air clean or how to help people who need it.

2. **The European Commission**: This is like the EU's office. They help make sure the rules are followed and that everyone is working together. They also suggest new ideas for the EU.

3. **The Council of the European Union**: This is where the leaders of the EU countries meet to make big decisions. They talk about things like how to keep people safe, how to help countries that need it, and how to make the EU even better.

Now, when people talk about the "Visit of the EU institutions," they usually mean going to see these places in person. You can go to Brussels, which is the capital of Belgium, to visit the European Parliament and the Council of the EU. The European Commission has its headquarters in Brussels too, but it also has offices in other cities like Luxembourg and Strasbourg.

When you visit these places, you can learn about how the EU works, see where important decisions are made, and maybe even meet some of the people who work there. It's like going on a field trip to learn about how your country and others work together!

Isn't that cool? I hope this helps you understand more about the Visit of the EU institutions. If you have any more questions
Q5_56_ I am 6 years old and from Romania. I know not at all about The European Youth Week or the European Youth Event. Can you tell me more about this? I am very curious to know more about this.

Hello! It's wonderful to hear that you're interested in learning about the European Youth Week and the European Youth Event. I'll do my best to explain them in a way that's easy for you to understand.

1. **European Youth Week**: Imagine you're having a big birthday party with all your friends from different countries. That's kind of what the European Youth Week is like, but for young people from all over Europe! It's a special week dedicated to celebrating and talking about the things that are important to young people like you.

   - **When does it happen?** It usually takes place in early May.
   - **What happens during the week?** There are many activities and events organized in different countries. These can include workshops, games, discussions, and performances. Young people get to share their ideas, learn from each other, and have fun together.
   - **Why is it important?** The European Youth Week helps young people to understand that they have a voice and that their opinions matter. It also helps them to learn about other cultures and to make new friends from different countries.

2. **European Youth Event (EYE)**: Now, imagine that birthday party I mentioned earlier, but this time it's a huge event where you can meet and talk to important people like the President of the European Parliament. That's what the European Youth Event is like!

   - **When and where does it happen?** It usually takes place in Strasbourg, France, where the European Parliament meets. It happens every two years, in May.
   - **What happens during the event?** Young people from all over Europe come together to discuss and vote on ideas for the future of Europe. They can also meet and talk to Members of the European Parliament, watch debates, and participate in workshops and games.
   - **Why is it important?** The European Youth Event gives young people a chance to have their say about the future of Europe.
Q5_57_ I am 6 years old and from Romania. I know not at all about Contacting a Commissioner or an MEP. Can you tell me more about this? I would like to know how to contact them and what I can ask them.

I am 6 years old and from Romania. I know not at all about Contacting a Commissioner or an MEP. Can you tell me more about this? I would like to know how to contact them and what I can ask them.

Commissioners and Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) are elected officials who work for the European Union (EU). They make decisions that affect many aspects of our lives, including how we travel, what we eat, and how we protect our environment. Here's a simple way to understand their roles and how you can contact them:

1. **Commissioners**: They are part of the European Commission, which is like the government of the EU. Each Commissioner is responsible for a specific area, such as agriculture, environment, or digital economy. You can write to them about issues related to their portfolio. Here's how you can contact them:

   - **Website**: You can find the list of Commissioners and their contact details on the European Commission's website: https://ec.europa.eu/commission/index_en
   - **Email**: You can send them an email using the contact form on their webpages.
   - **Post**: You can also write them a letter. The address is: European Commission, 1049 Brussels, Belgium.

2. **MEPs**: They are part of the European Parliament, which is the EU's legislative body. They represent the people of the EU and help make laws. You can write to them about any issue that's important to you. Here's how you can contact them:

   - **Website**: You can find the list of MEPs and their contact details on the European Parliament's website: https://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/home
   - **Email**: You can send them an email using the contact form on their webpages.

Q5_58_ I am 6 years old and from Romania. I know not at all about Participation in events organised by the EU in your country. Can you tell me more about this?
Q5_59_ I am 6 years old and from Romania. I know not at all about European Citizens’ Initiative. Can you tell me more about this? I am very curious.

Hello! It's wonderful to hear that you're curious about the European Citizens’ Initiative (ECI). I'll explain it in a simple way so that you can understand it better.

Imagine you have a school council where you and your friends can suggest ideas to make your school better. The European Union (EU) has something similar for its citizens, which is called the European Citizens’ Initiative.

The ECI is a way for EU citizens to suggest new laws or changes to existing laws. Here's how it works:

1. **Collecting signatures**: To start an ECI, you need to collect signatures from at least one million EU citizens from at least seven different EU countries. This is like collecting signatures from your classmates and friends from other classes to show that many people support your idea.

2. **Submitting the proposal**: Once you have collected enough signatures, you submit your proposal to the European Commission. The European Commission is like the principal of the EU school, and they decide whether to accept your proposal or not.

3. **Reviewing the proposal**: If the European Commission accepts your proposal, they will review it and decide whether to take action on it or not. They might decide to change the law, or they might decide that the law is already good as it is.

4. **Voting**: If the European Commission decides to take action on your proposal, they will present it to the European Parliament and the Council of the EU. These are like the teachers and parents of the EU school, and they will vote on whether to accept your proposal or not.

So, the ECI is a way for EU citizens to have a say in how the EU is run. It's like a big, important suggestion box where you can share your ideas and help make the EU a better place!
