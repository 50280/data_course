Q4b_42_ I am 6 years old and from Slovenia. I am a little interested in changing society in the area of Health and well-being. Can you tell me how I can do this? I want to help people to be healthy and happy.

Hello! It's wonderful to hear that you're already thinking about how to make the world a healthier and happier place. Here are some simple ways you can start making a difference, even at your young age:

1. **Educate Yourself**: Learn about health and well-being. You can ask your parents or teachers to help you find books, videos, or websites that explain these topics in a way that's easy for kids to understand.

2. **Share What You Learn**: Once you've learned something new, share it with others. You can tell your friends, family, or even create a simple poster to hang up at home or school.

3. **Encourage Physical Activity**: Make sure you're getting enough exercise. This could be playing outside, dancing, or doing yoga. You can also encourage your friends and family to join you.

4. **Eat Healthy**: Try to eat more fruits and vegetables. You can help with cooking or preparing snacks at home. Remember, it's okay to have treats sometimes too!

5. **Practice Good Hygiene**: This includes washing your hands regularly, brushing your teeth, and taking baths or showers. You can remind your friends and family to do the same.

6. **Mental Health Matters**: Make sure you're getting enough rest and sleep. You can also practice relaxation techniques like deep breathing or meditation. Remember, it's okay to ask for help if you're feeling sad or worried.

7. **Be Kind**: Kindness is a big part of well-being. Treat others with kindness and respect. You can also help those in need, like volunteering at a local animal shelter or helping with community clean-up projects.

8. **Advocate for Change**: If you see something that you think could be better, like a lack of playground equipment or unhealthy food in your school, talk to your parents or teachers about it. They can help you

Q4b_44_ I am 6 years old and from Slovenia. I am a little interested in changing society in the area of Equal rights regardless of gender, race or sexuality. Can you tell me how I can do this? I want to be a hero.

Dear little hero,

It's wonderful to hear that you're already thinking about making the world a better place! Here are some simple ways you can start promoting equality and understanding, even at your young age:

1. **Be Kind and Inclusive**: Treat everyone with kindness and respect, regardless of their gender, skin color, or who they like. Invite everyone to play and include them in your games. This helps create a more inclusive environment and shows others that everyone deserves to be treated equally.

2. **Learn and Share**: Ask your parents, teachers, or librarians to help you learn more about different cultures, races, and genders. You can read books, watch educational shows, or have conversations about these topics. The more you understand, the more you can share with others and help them understand too.

3. **Stand Up for Others**: If you see someone being treated unfairly or unkindly, it's brave to stand up for them. You can do this by telling the person who is being mean to stop, or by telling a trusted adult like a teacher or parent. Remember, it's important to stay safe and not put yourself in harm's way.

4. **Use Your Voice**: You can use your voice to speak up for equality. You can talk to your friends, family, and classmates about why it's important to treat everyone equally. You can also write stories, draw pictures, or make videos about equality and share them with others.

5. **Help at Home**: You can help promote equality at home by setting a good example. You can help with chores that are typically done by people of any gender, like cooking, cleaning, or taking care of pets. You can also ask your parents to explain why it's important for everyone to have equal opportunities.

6. **Join a Club or Group**: There might be clubs or groups in your school or community that focus on promoting equality. Joining

Q5_51_ I am 6 years old and from Slovenia. I know not at all about Citizens’ dialogue, EU Youth Dialogue or EU Youth Conference. Can you tell me more about this? I am very curious.

Dear friend,

I'm glad you're curious about these topics! Let's imagine you're in a big playground called Europe, where many children from different countries come to play together. This playground has some special rules and activities that make it fun for everyone.

1. **Citizens' Dialogue**: Imagine you're playing with your friends, and sometimes you have disagreements about how to play a game or share toys. To solve these issues, you all sit down together, listen to each other's ideas, and try to find a solution that everyone likes. This is similar to a Citizens' Dialogue. In this dialogue, grown-ups from different European countries meet to discuss important topics, like how to make the playground (Europe) a better place for everyone. They listen to each other's ideas, ask questions, and try to find solutions together. This helps them understand different perspectives and work together to improve things.

2. **EU Youth Dialogue**: Now, imagine there's a special club in the playground where only children can join. In this club, you can talk about things that are important to you, like how to make the playground more fun, how to include everyone in games, or how to make sure everyone has enough snacks. This club is like the EU Youth Dialogue. It's a place where young people from all over Europe can meet, share their ideas, and talk about things that matter to them. They can give their opinions on how to make Europe a better place for young people, and these ideas can even influence the rules of the playground (EU policies).

3. **EU Youth Conference**: Finally, imagine that once a year, the playground organizes a big party where all the children can come together, play games, and share their experiences. During this party, they also talk about what they've learned throughout the year and how they can work together to make the playground even better. This is like the EU Youth Conference. It's a
Q5_52_ I am 6 years old and from Slovenia. I know not at all about Public consultations. Can you tell me more about this? I am very curious.

Hello! It's wonderful to hear that you're curious about public consultations. I'll explain it in a simple way so that you can understand.

Imagine you're in your classroom, and your teacher wants to make some changes, like moving the desks or adding new games to the playground. Before making these changes, your teacher might ask you and your classmates what you think about the ideas. This is similar to a public consultation.

A public consultation is when grown-ups, like people who work for the government or big organizations, ask other people (like you and your neighbors) for their opinions and ideas about something they want to do or change. This could be about building a new park, changing some rules, or even deciding how to make things better in your city or country.

Here's why public consultations are important:

1. **Your voice matters**: By sharing your thoughts and ideas, you can help make decisions that affect you and your community.

2. **Learning and understanding**: Public consultations help you learn about things that are happening around you and understand why certain decisions are being made.

3. **Making better decisions**: When people share their ideas and opinions, the grown-ups can make better decisions because they have more information and different perspectives to consider.

So, even though you might not have heard about public consultations before, you've probably experienced something similar in your classroom or at home. It's all about listening to each other and working together to make good decisions. Keep being curious, and don't forget that your voice is important!

Q5_54_ I am 6 years old and from Slovenia. I know a little about EU social media channels and websites (i.e. European Youth Portal). Can you tell me more about this? I am interested in the EU and I want to learn more about it.

Hello! It's wonderful to hear that you're interested in learning more about the European Union (EU) at such a young age. The EU has several social media channels and websites that can help you learn more about it in a fun and interactive way. Here are some of them:

1. **European Youth Portal (https://europa.eu/youth/)**
   - This is a great place for young people like you to find information about studying, working, volunteering, and understanding the EU. It has games, quizzes, and interactive tools to make learning about the EU more enjoyable.

Q5_55_ I am 6 years old and from Slovenia. I know a little about Visit of the EU institutions. Can you tell me more about this? What is the EU?

The EU, or European Union, is a group of 27 countries that work together to make rules and laws that affect how they trade with each other, how they protect the environment, and how they work together on many other issues. The EU has its own parliament, called the European Parliament, where people from each country vote for representatives to make decisions about the EU. The EU also has a president, called the President of the European Commission, who helps to lead the EU and make sure that the rules and laws are followed.

The EU has its headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, where many of the EU's institutions are located. These institutions include the European Commission, which is the main body that makes new laws and policies for the EU, and the Council of the European Union, which is where representatives from each country meet to discuss and make decisions about EU policies.

The EU also has its own currency, called the Euro, which is used by 19 of the 27 member countries. The Euro is managed by the European Central Bank, which is based in Frankfurt, Germany.

The EU was created to help the countries of Europe work together and cooperate on issues that affect them all. By working together, the EU countries are able to have more influence in the world and to make sure that their voices are heard on important issues.

I hope that helps to explain what the EU is! If you have any other questions, just let me know.
Q5_56_ I am 6 years old and from Slovenia. I know a little about The European Youth Week or the European Youth Event. Can you tell me more about this? What is it and why is it important?

Hello! It's wonderful to hear from you. I'm glad to help explain the European Youth Week and the European Youth Event in a way that's easy to understand.

1. **European Youth Week (EYW)**: Imagine a big party where young people from all over Europe come together to celebrate and talk about important things that affect their lives. That's what the European Youth Week is like! It happens every year in May, and it's organized by the Council of Europe, which is like a big club of European countries that work together to protect human rights and democracy.

   - **Why is it important?**
     - It's a chance for young people to have their voices heard. They can share their ideas and opinions about things like education, health, and the environment with people who can make changes happen.
     - It helps young people from different countries learn about each other's cultures and make new friends.
     - It shows that young people care about their future and want to be involved in shaping it.

2. **European Youth Event (EYE)**: The European Youth Event is like a bigger version of the European Youth Week, but it only happens every three years. It's organized by the European Parliament, which is the part of the European Union that represents the people of Europe. The EYE takes place in Strasbourg, France, where the European Parliament meets.

   - **Why is it important?**
     - It's a unique opportunity for young people to meet and talk with Members of the European Parliament, who are the people who make laws for the European Union.
     - It's a chance for young people to learn about how the European Union works and how they can get involved in decision-making processes.
     - It helps young people from different countries come together, share their ideas, and work on projects together.

In both the European Youth Week and the European Youth Event, young people are encouraged to be active,

Q5_58_ I am 6 years old and from Slovenia. I know not at all about Participation in events organised by the EU in your country. Can you tell me more about this?
Q5_59_ I am 6 years old and from Slovenia. I know not at all about European Citizens’ Initiative. Can you tell me more about this? I would like to know what it is, how it works and how I can participate.

Dear friend,

I'm delighted to help you understand the European Citizens' Initiative (ECI) in a simple and fun way!

1. **What is the European Citizens' Initiative?**
Imagine you have a great idea that you think could make Europe a better place. The ECI is like a big suggestion box for the European Union (EU). It's a way for citizens like you to suggest changes to EU policies. It's called an "initiative" because it's something you start or suggest.

2. **How does it work?**
To start an ECI, you need to collect signatures from at least one million EU citizens from at least seven different EU countries. This is like asking your friends and family to support your idea. Here's a simple breakdown:

   - **Step 1: Register your idea** with the European Commission. You'll need to explain your idea clearly and show how it could improve life in the EU.

   - **Step 2: Collect signatures**. You'll have one year to collect at least one million signatures from EU citizens. You can do this online or using paper forms. Remember, you need signatures from at least seven different EU countries.

   - **Step 3: The European Commission checks your signatures**. If you've collected enough, they'll look into your idea and see if it's possible to make it into a law.

   - **Step 4: The European Commission responds**. They'll tell you and all the people who signed if your idea can be made into a law, or why not.

3. **How can you participate?**
Even though you're too young to start an ECI or sign one, you can still participate in other ways:

   - **Talk about it**: Share what you've learned about the ECI with your friends, family, and teachers. You can help spread the word about this cool way to
