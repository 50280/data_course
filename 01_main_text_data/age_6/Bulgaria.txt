Dear little friend,

I'm delighted to help you understand the European Citizens' Initiative (ECI) in a simple and fun way!

Imagine you have a great idea that you think could make Europe a better place for everyone, just like you. The ECI is like a big suggestion box where you and other kids, as well as grown-ups, from all over Europe can share your ideas with the European Commission, which is like the manager of Europe.

Here's how it works:

1. **Collect signatures**: First, you need to find at least one million people from at least seven different European countries who love your idea and are willing to sign a petition to support it. This is like asking your friends and family to agree with your suggestion.

2. **Register your idea**: Once you have collected the signatures, you need to register your idea with the European Commission. They will check if your idea is legal and can be done by the European Union (EU).

3. **Wait for a response**: After registering, the European Commission will have three months to decide if they will take action on your idea. If they think your idea is good, they might propose a new law or policy to help make it happen.

4. **Celebrate**: If your idea becomes a new law or policy, you and all the people who supported your ECI can celebrate knowing that you helped make Europe a better place!

The ECI is a fantastic way for people from all over Europe to come together and share their ideas to improve our continent. It's like a big, friendly conversation where everyone's voice is heard. Even though you're just 6 years old, you already have great ideas, and who knows, maybe one day you'll start your own ECI! Keep dreaming big and being curious about the world around you.
