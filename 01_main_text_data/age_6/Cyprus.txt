1. **Educate Yourself and Others**: Learn more about climate change and environmental issues. You can read books, watch documentaries, and talk to your teachers and parents about what you've learned. Share this knowledge with your friends and family to raise awareness.

2. **Plant Trees**: Trees absorb carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change. You can start a small garden at home or participate in local tree-planting events. Every tree counts!

3. **Reduce, Reuse, Recycle**: Follow the three R's to reduce waste. Reduce the amount of stuff you use, reuse items as much as possible, and recycle materials that can be recycled. You can also encourage your family and friends to do the same.

4. **Save Energy**: Turn off lights and electronics when you're not using them. Use energy-efficient light bulbs and appliances. You can also help by reminding your family to do the same.

5. **Save Water**: Turn off the tap while brushing your teeth or washing your hands. Fix any leaks in your home. Collect rainwater to water your plants.

6. **Protect Wildlife**: Create a safe space for local wildlife in your backyard or neighborhood. You can build birdhouses, create a small pond, or plant native plants that provide food and shelter for local animals.

7. **Participate in Clean-Up Events**: Join local clean-up events to help keep your community clean and safe for both people and wildlife.

8. **Advocate for Change**: Write letters to your local leaders, or even the Prime Minister of Cyprus, to express your concerns about climate change and environmental protection. You can also participate in protests and marches to raise your voice.

Dear young leader,

It's wonderful to hear that you're already thinking about making a positive impact on society at such a young age! Here are some steps you can take to become a leader in promoting equal rights:

1. **Educate Yourself**: Learn about different types of equality, such as gender equality, racial equality, and LGBTQ+ rights. Read books, watch documentaries, and talk to people about these topics. The more you know, the better you can understand and explain these issues to others.

2. **Start at Home**: Begin by promoting equality in your own home and family. Treat everyone with kindness and respect, regardless of their gender, race, or who they love. Encourage your family to do the same.

3. **Spread Awareness at School**: Talk to your friends and classmates about the importance of equality. You can start a conversation about why it's important to treat everyone fairly, and why things like racism, sexism, and homophobia are wrong. You can also ask your teacher to incorporate lessons about equality into your curriculum.

4. **Join or Start a Club**: See if there's a club at your school that focuses on social justice or equality. If there isn't, you could start one! This can be a great way to meet other kids who care about these issues and to plan activities that promote equality.

5. **Participate in Community Events**: Look for local events that support equality, like pride parades, women's marches, or community clean-ups. Participating in these events can help you feel more connected to your community and show others that you stand for equality.

6. **Use Your Voice**: Don't be afraid to speak up when you see something that's not fair. If you see someone being treated unfairly, stand up for them. If you hear someone making a hurtful joke or comment, tell them why it's not okay.

Dear young activist,

It's wonderful to hear that you're already thinking about how to make a positive impact on society, especially in the area of human rights. Here are some steps you can take now to start your journey:

1. **Learn about Human Rights**: Start by understanding what human rights are. The United Nations has a great resource called "The Rights of the Child" which explains the rights of children in a simple and easy-to-understand way. You can find it here: https://www.unicef.org/rightsite/5792_34175.html

2. **Talk to Others**: Discuss human rights with your family, friends, and teachers. Share what you've learned and listen to their thoughts and experiences. This will help you understand different perspectives and deepen your own understanding.

3. **Read Books**: There are many children's books that talk about human rights and social justice. Some recommendations include "The Little Book of Human Rights" by Chris Gall, "I Have the Right to Be a Child" by Alain Serres, and "A is for Activist" by Innosanto Nagara.

4. **Get Involved in Your Community**: Look for opportunities to participate in local community service or advocacy projects. This could be anything from helping at a local animal shelter to participating in a community clean-up day. Websites like VolunteerMatch can help you find opportunities near you.

5. **Write Letters or Start a Blog**: You can write letters to local politicians, newspaper editors, or even the United Nations to express your views on human rights issues. You could also start a blog or a YouTube channel to share your thoughts and ideas with a wider audience.

Q4b_46_ I am 6 years old and from Cyprus. I am a little interested in changing society in the area of Wars and conflicts. Can you tell me how I can do this? I want to be a peace maker.

Dear friend,

It's wonderful to hear that you're already thinking about how to make the world a better place, especially at such a young age! Here are some steps you can take to become a peace maker:

1. **Learn about Peace**: Start by learning more about peace, what it means, and why it's important. You can read books, watch educational videos, or talk to your parents, teachers, or other adults about it.

2. **Understand Conflicts**: To understand how to make peace, it's also important to learn about conflicts. This doesn't mean you need to learn about the details of wars, but rather understand why people might have disagreements and how these can be resolved peacefully.

3. **Practice Peace at Home**: The first place to start making peace is at home. This could mean sharing your toys with your siblings, helping with chores, or being kind to your family members. When you see that peace can make people happy at home, you'll understand why it's important in the wider world.

4. **Be Kind at School**: At school, you can practice peace by being kind to your classmates, helping those who might be struggling, and resolving conflicts peacefully. This could mean talking things out instead of fighting, or helping others to do the same.

5. **Spread Kindness**: You can also spread kindness and peace in your community. This could mean helping neighbors, volunteering at a local charity, or even just smiling and saying hello to people you meet.

6. **Educate Others**: As you learn more about peace, you can teach others. This could mean talking to your friends about why peace is important, or even giving a presentation at school.

7. **Write to Leaders**: When you're older, you could write to your local leaders, or even the President or Prime Minister, to tell them about your ideas for peace. They might not be

Q5_51_ I am 6 years old and from Cyprus. I know not at all about Citizens’ dialogue, EU Youth Dialogue or EU Youth Conference. Can you tell me more about this? I am very curious to learn more about this.

Dear friend,

I'm delighted to help you understand these important topics! Let's break them down into simpler parts so you can easily understand them.

1. **EU (European Union)**: Imagine you have a big group of friends from different countries, like Greece, Italy, Germany, France, and many more. They all decide to work together, play together, and help each other. That's similar to the European Union. It's a group of 27 countries that work together for the benefit of their people.

2. **Citizens' Dialogue**: Now, imagine you and your friends want to talk about something important, like how to make your school or playground better. You all sit down, listen to each other, and share your ideas. That's what a Citizens' Dialogue is. It's a meeting where people from different places in the EU come together to talk about important topics and share their thoughts and ideas. This helps everyone understand different points of view and work together to find solutions.

3. **EU Youth Dialogue**: You know how sometimes you and your friends have special meetings to talk about things that are important to you, like your favorite games, books, or how to make recess more fun? The EU Youth Dialogue is like that, but for young people from all over the EU. It's a conversation where young people can share their ideas, concerns, and hopes about the future. This helps the EU understand what's important to young people and how they can support them.

4. **EU Youth Conference**: Think of this as a big party where all your friends from different schools and neighborhoods come together to celebrate and talk about the things you've all been working on. The EU Youth Conference is like that, but for young people from the EU. It's a big event where young people from different countries come together to share their ideas, learn from each other, and celebrate their achievements. It's a
Q5_52_ I am 6 years old and from Cyprus. I know not at all about Public consultations. Can you tell me more about this? I am very curious to learn about it.

Hello! It's wonderful to hear that you're curious about public consultations. I'll explain it in a simple way so that you can understand.

Imagine you're in your classroom, and your teacher wants to make some changes, like moving the desks or adding new books to the library. Before making these changes, your teacher might ask you and your classmates what you think about the ideas. This is similar to a public consultation.

A public consultation is when people in charge of making decisions (like your teacher or grown-ups who run a city or a country) ask other people (like you and your classmates) for their opinions and ideas before they make important choices. This way, everyone can have a say in what happens in their community or country.

Here are some reasons why public consultations are important:

1. **Everyone's voice matters**: Public consultations give everyone a chance to share their thoughts and feelings. This includes kids like you!

2. **Better decisions**: When people in charge listen to others, they can make better decisions because they have more information and ideas to consider.

3. **Feeling involved**: When you have a say in what happens, you feel more involved and interested in your community.

4. **Learning and understanding**: Public consultations help you learn more about different topics and understand why certain decisions are made.

So, even though you're just 6 years old, your opinions and ideas are important! If you ever get a chance to take part in a public consultation, don't be shy to share your thoughts. You never know, your ideas might help make your community an even better place! Keep being curious and asking questions, it's a great way to learn about the world around you.

Q5_54_ I am 6 years old and from Cyprus. I know a little about EU social media channels and websites (i.e. European Youth Portal). Can you tell me more about this? I am interested in learning more about the EU and its social media channels.

Hello! It's great to hear that you're interested in learning more about the European Union (EU) and its social media channels. The EU has several platforms where you can find information and engage with others. Here are some of them:

1. **European Youth Portal (https://europa.eu/youth/)**: This is a great place for young people like you to find information about opportunities, rights, and activities related to the EU. You can learn about study and work opportunities, youth mobility programs, and how to get involved in decision-making processes. They also have a section called "Youth in Action" where you can find stories and experiences from other young people.

2. **EU Social Media Channels**: The EU has official accounts on many popular social media platforms. Here are a few:

   - **Facebook**: The EU has several official pages, including the main EU page (https://www.facebook.com/EUinmyregion/), which shares news, events, and stories from across the EU.

Q5_55_ I am 6 years old and from Cyprus. I know not at all about Visit of the EU institutions. Can you tell me more about this?
Q5_56_ I am 6 years old and from Cyprus. I know a little about The European Youth Week or the European Youth Event. Can you tell me more about this? What is it? What do young people do there? What is the purpose of this event?

The European Youth Week and the European Youth Event are initiatives organized by the European Union to engage and involve young people in the democratic life of Europe. Here's a simple explanation for you:

1. **European Youth Week**: This is a week-long event that happens every year in May. It's like a big party where young people from all over Europe come together to celebrate their diversity, share their ideas, and learn about each other's cultures. During this week, there are many activities like workshops, games, music, and art. The purpose is to bring young people together, help them understand the EU better, and encourage them to participate in shaping Europe's future.

2. **European Youth Event (EYE)**: This is a bigger event that happens every two years in the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France. It's like a big festival where young people can meet and talk to Members of the European Parliament, share their ideas, and learn about how the EU works. There are also many workshops, debates, and cultural activities. The purpose of EYE is to give young people a voice in the EU, to listen to their ideas and concerns, and to inspire them to get involved in democracy.

In both events, young people can learn about important topics like human rights, the environment, education, and many others. They can also meet other young people from different countries and make new friends. The main goal is to make young people feel that the EU is their Europe, and that they have a say in how it's run.

So, in simple terms, these events are like big parties where young people from all over Europe come together to have fun, learn, and share their ideas about how to make Europe a better place.
Q5_57_ I am 6 years old and from Cyprus. I know not at all about Contacting a Commissioner or an MEP. Can you tell me more about this? I would like to know how to contact them and what I can ask them.

Dear friend,

It's wonderful that you're interested in learning about how to contact a Commissioner or a Member of the European Parliament (MEP). Here's a simple guide to help you understand how to do this and what you might want to ask them.

1. **Who are they?**
   - **Commissioners**: They are the members of the European Commission, which is the executive branch of the European Union (EU). They are responsible for proposing new laws and policies for the EU. There are 27 Commissioners, one from each EU country.
   - **MEPs**: They are the members of the European Parliament, which is the legislative branch of the EU. They are elected by EU citizens to represent their interests and pass EU laws.

2. **How to contact them?**
   - **Commissioners**: You can find the contact details of each Commissioner on the European Commission's website. Here's the link: [https://ec.europa.eu/commission/commissioners_en](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/commissioners_en). You can write them a letter or send an email. If you're not sure which Commissioner to contact, you can write to the President of the Commission, Ursula von der Leyen.
   - **MEPs**: You can find the contact details of MEPs on the European Parliament's website. Here's the link: [https://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/home](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/home). You can write them a letter or send an email. If you're from Cyprus, you can contact any of the Cypriot MEPs.

3. **What can you ask them?**
   - You can ask them about any topic that you're interested in or that affects you. Here are a few ideas:
     - **Environment**: You could ask them
Q5_58_ I am 6 years old and from Cyprus. I know not at all about Participation in events organised by the EU in your country. Can you tell me more about this?
Q5_59_ I am 6 years old and from Cyprus. I know  about European Citizens’ Initiative. Can you tell me more about this? What is it?

A European Citizens’ Initiative (ECI) is a way for citizens of the European Union (EU) to directly influence the EU’s decision-making process. It allows you to propose a new law or change an existing one. Here are some simple steps to understand how it works:

1. **Collecting Support**: To start an ECI, you need to collect at least one million signatures from EU citizens. These signatures must come from at least seven different EU countries, and each country must have at least 0.2% of its population represented in the signatures.

2. **Registering the ECI**: Once you have collected the signatures, you need to register your ECI with the European Commission. They will check if your proposal meets the criteria to be considered.

3. **Commission's Response**: If your ECI is registered, the European Commission will have to respond to your proposal. They can either decide to propose a legal act based on your initiative, or explain why they won't.

4. **Parliament's Role**: The European Parliament can also give an opinion on your proposal. They can ask the Commission to propose a legal act, or they can ask the Council of the EU to do so.

5. **Council's Role**: The Council of the EU, which represents the governments of the EU countries, can also decide to propose a legal act based on your initiative.

So, in simple terms, an ECI is like a petition that you can start if you have an idea for a new EU law or a change to an existing one. If enough people support your idea, the EU institutions will have to consider it.
