6. **Talk to Your Family and Friends**: Discuss your ideas with your family and friends. They can help you understand different perspectives and support you in your efforts.

7. **Learn About Democracy**: Read books, watch videos, or talk to teachers about democracy. The more you understand it, the better you can participate.

8. **Start Small**: You don't have to start with big changes. You can start by making decisions at home, like what to have for dinner or what game to play with your friends.

Q3_33_ I am 6 years old and from Slovakia. I have never taken part in activities that relate to democratic participation because These activities are too far away. It is difficult to get there from my home  (e.g. by public transport). For my friends, this is a lot the same. Can you tell me more about how I can do that? Thank you.

   - Youth Voice: A platform by the UK's Youth Parliament where young people can share their views. (https://www.ukyouthparliament.org.uk/youth-voice/)

2. **Write Letters or Emails**: You can write letters or emails to your local representatives, such as your mayor or member of parliament. They represent you and it's their job to listen to your concerns and ideas. You can find their contact information online.

Q4b_41_ I am 6 years old and from Slovakia. I am a little interested in changing society in the area of Climate change and environmental protection. Can you tell me how I can do this? I would like to do something good for the environment.

Hello! It's wonderful to hear that you're already thinking about how to make a positive impact on the environment at such a young age. Here are some simple and fun ways you can help protect the environment:

1. **Plant Trees**: You can start a small garden in your backyard or even in pots if you live in an apartment. Trees absorb carbon dioxide, which helps combat climate change. You can also participate in local tree-planting events.

2. **Reduce, Reuse, Recycle**: Learn about the three R's and try to implement them in your daily life. Reduce waste by using less, reuse items as much as possible, and recycle materials that can be recycled.

3. **Save Water and Energy**: Turn off lights and electronics when you're not using them. Take shorter showers to save water. You can also help with simple tasks like turning off the tap while brushing your teeth.

4. **Clean Up**: Organize or participate in local clean-up events. You can help pick up litter in your neighborhood or a nearby park.

5. **Educate Others**: Share what you've learned about the environment with your friends, family, and classmates. You can start a small club or group at your school to discuss and take action on environmental issues.

6. **Write Letters**: Write letters to your local politicians or leaders to express your concerns about climate change and environmental protection. You can also write to companies to encourage them to adopt more sustainable practices.

7. **Support Environmental Organizations**: Many organizations work to protect the environment. You can help by donating (if you have pocket money) or by raising funds through small events like a lemonade stand or a bake sale.

8. **Learn More**: Read books, watch documentaries, and explore websites that talk about the environment. The more you learn, the more you'll understand how to help.

9. **Protect Wildlife**:
Q4b_42_ I am 6 years old and from Slovakia. I am a little interested in changing society in the area of Health and well-being. Can you tell me how I can do this? Thank you.

Dear friend,

It's wonderful to hear that you're already thinking about how to make the world a better place, especially in the areas of health and well-being. Here are some simple ways you can start making a difference, even at your young age:

1. **Educate Yourself and Others**: Learn about health and well-being. You can start by reading books, watching educational videos, or talking to your parents, teachers, or healthcare professionals. Once you've learned something new, share it with your friends and family. You can teach them about the importance of eating healthy foods, exercising regularly, getting enough sleep, and staying hydrated.

2. **Practice Good Habits**: Model the behaviors you've learned. Make sure you're eating healthy foods, drinking plenty of water, getting enough sleep, and being active every day. You can also practice good hygiene habits like washing your hands regularly to prevent the spread of germs.

3. **Help Others**: Look for ways to help others in your community. This could be as simple as helping a neighbor with their groceries, or participating in a community service project. You could also raise awareness about important health issues. For example, you could create posters or flyers about the importance of wearing a helmet when riding a bike or the dangers of smoking.

4. **Fundraise**: If there's a specific health cause you're passionate about, you could organize a fundraiser to raise money for it. This could be a lemonade stand, a bake sale, or a sponsored event like a walk or a bike ride.

5. **Advocate**: Speak up for what you believe in. If you see something that's not fair or healthy, like someone being bullied or a park without any playground equipment, talk to your parents, teachers, or other adults about it. They can help you figure out how to make a change.

6. **Be Kind**: Remember that everyone is unique and special

Dear little hero,

It's wonderful to hear that you're already thinking about making the world a better place! Here are some simple ways you can start making a difference, even at your young age:

1. **Learn and Understand**: Start by learning about different people, their cultures, and their experiences. This will help you understand why it's important to treat everyone equally. You can ask your parents, teachers, or librarians to help you find books, movies, or games that teach about diversity.

2. **Be Kind**: Treat everyone with kindness and respect, regardless of their gender, race, or who they love. This is the most important thing you can do. If you see someone being left out or treated unfairly, try to include them or stand up for them.

3. **Share What You Know**: Tell your friends and family about what you've learned. You can teach them about the importance of equal rights and how to be kind to everyone. You can also share books, movies, or games that you've enjoyed and that teach about diversity.

4. **Draw Pictures or Write Stories**: You can create art or write stories that show everyone being treated equally and kindly. You can share these with your family and friends, or even with your school.

5. **Help at Home**: You can help your parents with chores, no matter what they are. This shows that everyone can do their part to help, regardless of their age or gender.

6. **Participate in Community Events**: If there are events in your community that celebrate diversity, like cultural festivals or pride parades, ask your parents if you can participate. This can be a fun way to learn and show your support.

7. **Be Patient and Persistent**: Change takes time, and it's important to keep trying, even if you don't see results right away. Keep being kind, keep learning, and keep sharing what you know.

Dear friend,

It's wonderful to hear that you're already thinking about how to make the world a more peaceful place! Here are some steps you can take, even at your young age:

1. **Learn and Understand**: Start by learning more about peace, wars, and conflicts. You can ask your parents, teachers, or librarians to help you find books, videos, or games that explain these topics in a way that's easy for you to understand.

2. **Share What You've Learned**: Talk to your friends, family, and classmates about what you've learned. You can teach them about the importance of peace and how they can help too.

3. **Be Kind and Respectful**: Treat everyone with kindness and respect. This includes your family, friends, and even people you don't know very well. When people feel respected and valued, they're less likely to fight or argue.

4. **Solve Conflicts Peacefully**: If you have a disagreement with someone, try to solve it without fighting. You can talk about your feelings, listen to the other person's perspective, and work together to find a solution.

5. **Help Others**: Look for ways to help people in your community. This could be as simple as helping a neighbor with their groceries or volunteering at a local charity. When people work together to help each other, it can bring communities closer and reduce conflicts.

6. **Write to Leaders**: When you're older, you can write letters to your country's leaders to share your thoughts about peace and how you think they can help. You can also write to organizations that work for peace, like the United Nations.

Dear young friend,

It's wonderful to hear about your interest in making a positive change in society, especially at such a young age! Here are some steps you can take to start your journey towards becoming a lawyer and promoting democracy and the rule of law:

1. **Educate Yourself**: Start by learning more about democracy, rule of law, and human rights. Read books, watch educational videos, and talk to your parents, teachers, and other adults about these topics. Some children's books that touch on these subjects include "The Little Book of Sloth Philosophy" by Joshua Foust, "The Canary and the Crow" by Darryl C. Wilson, and "The Little Book of Big Ideas" by Michael Leunig.

2. **Understand Your Rights**: Learn about your rights as a child and as a citizen. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights are great places to start. Understanding your rights will help you appreciate the importance of the rule of law.

Q5_51_ I am 6 years old and from Slovakia. I know not at all about Citizens’ dialogue, EU Youth Dialogue or EU Youth Conference. Can you tell me more about this? I am very curious.

Dear friend,

I'm glad you're curious about these topics! Let's imagine you're in a big playground called Europe, where many children from different countries come to play together. This playground has some special rules and activities that make it fun for everyone.

1. **Citizens' Dialogue**: Imagine you're playing with your friends, and sometimes you have disagreements about how to play a game or share toys. To solve these issues, you all sit down and talk about your ideas and feelings. You listen to each other and try to find a solution that makes everyone happy. That's similar to a Citizens' Dialogue. It's a meeting where people from different countries in Europe come together to talk about important topics, like how to make the playground (Europe) a better place for everyone. They share their ideas and listen to each other, just like you and your friends do when you have a disagreement.

2. **EU Youth Dialogue**: Now, imagine there's a special club in the playground where only children can join. In this club, you can talk about things that are important to you, like how to make the playground more fun, or how to help other children who might be feeling left out. The EU Youth Dialogue is like this club. It's a place where young people from all over Europe can come together to talk about issues that matter to them. They share their ideas and suggestions with each other and with the grown-ups who take care of the playground (the European Union).

3. **EU Youth Conference**: Finally, imagine that once a year, the playground organizes a big party where all the children can come together to celebrate and talk about the things they've been working on throughout the year. They can share their experiences, learn from each other, and even perform or present the projects they've been working on. The EU Youth Conference is like this party. It's a big event where young people from all over Europe come together
Q5_52_ I am 6 years old and from Slovakia. I know a little about Public consultations. Can you tell me more about this? I would like to know what is the purpose of public consultations and how they work. I would also like to like to know how I can participate in them.

Hello! It's wonderful to hear that you're interested in learning about public consultations at such a young age. I'll do my best to explain this in a simple way.

1. **What are Public Consultations?**
Public consultations are like big conversations between the people who make rules (like governments or organizations) and the people who will be affected by those rules (like you and me). The purpose is to gather different opinions and ideas before a decision is made. This helps to make sure that the decision is fair and takes into account what most people want or need.

2. **Why are they important?**
Public consultations are important because they give everyone a chance to have a say in the things that affect their lives. They help to make sure that decisions are made with the best information and the widest range of views. They also help to build trust between the people who make decisions and the people who are affected by them.

3. **How do they work?**
Public consultations can work in different ways. Sometimes, there are meetings where people can talk about their ideas and concerns. Other times, there are online surveys or questionnaires where people can fill in their thoughts. Sometimes, people can write letters or emails to share their views. The people who are running the consultation will usually tell you how you can take part.

4. **How can you participate?**
Even though you're 6 years old, you can still have your say in public consultations! Here are a few ways you can participate:

   - **With your parents or guardians**: They can help you fill in a survey or write a letter. You can tell them your thoughts and they can help you express them in a way that's easy to understand.

   - **At a meeting**: If there's a meeting for the consultation, you could ask your

Q5_57_ I am 6 years old and from Slovakia. I know a lot about Contacting a Commissioner or an MEP. Can you tell me more about this? I want to know more about the European Union.

Dear friend,

It's wonderful to hear that you're interested in learning more about the European Union (EU) at such a young age! I'm here to help you understand how the EU works and how you can get involved.

The European Union is a group of 27 countries that work together to make decisions and policies that affect their citizens. It was created to promote peace, stability, and cooperation among its member states. Here are some key aspects of the EU and how you can engage with it:

1. **European Commission**: The European Commission is the executive branch of the EU. It proposes new laws and policies, manages the EU's budget, and makes sure that EU laws are enforced. The Commission is led by a President and has 27 Commissioners, one from each member state. You can write to the Commissioners to share your ideas, concerns, or ask questions about EU policies. Here's how you can do that:

   - Find the list of Commissioners and their portfolios: https://ec.europa.eu/commission/president/commissioners_en
   - Click on the Commissioner you want to contact and follow the instructions on their page to send a message.

2. **European Parliament**: The European Parliament is the legislative branch of the EU. It's made up of Members of the European Parliament (MEPs), who are elected every five years by EU citizens. MEPs represent EU citizens and have the power to pass or reject new laws. You can contact MEPs to share your thoughts on EU policies or ask them to raise issues in the Parliament. Here's how:

   - Find your MEPs: https://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/search
   - Click on the MEP you want to contact and follow the instructions on their page to send a message.

3. **European Council**: The European Council is the body where the heads of state or government of

Q5_59_ I am 6 years old and from Slovakia. I know not at all about European Citizens’ Initiative. Can you tell me more about this? I would like to know what it is and how it works.

Dear friend,

I'm glad you're interested in learning about the European Citizens' Initiative (ECI)! I'll explain it in a simple way, just for you.

1. **What is the European Citizens' Initiative?**
   Imagine you have an idea that you think could make Europe a better place. The ECI is like a big suggestion box for the European Union (EU). It's a way for citizens like you, from any of the EU countries, to suggest new laws or changes to existing ones.

2. **How does it work?**
   - **Step 1: Gather support.** You need to find at least one million people from at least seven different EU countries who support your idea. These people are called "signatories". They show their support by signing your proposal online or on a paper form.
   - **Step 2: Prepare your proposal.** You need to write a proposal that explains your idea clearly. It should also say what law or change you want the EU to make.
   - **Step 3: Submit your proposal.** Once you have enough signatories, you can submit your proposal to the European Commission. The European Commission is like the government of the EU. They decide if your proposal can be accepted or not.
   - **Step 4: The European Commission's response.** If your proposal is accepted, the European Commission will give you a response within six months. They might decide to make a new law or change an existing one, or they might explain why they can't do what you're asking for.

3. **Why is it important?**
   The ECI is important because it gives citizens a voice in the EU. It's a way for people to come together and say, "We think this is important, and we want the EU to do something about it." It helps to make the EU more democratic.

4. **Can I start an
