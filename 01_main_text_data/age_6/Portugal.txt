Q4b_47_ I am 6 years old and from Portugal. I am a little interested in changing society in the area of Democracy and rule of law. Can you tell me how I can do this? I want to be a lawyer when I grow up.

Dear young friend,

It's wonderful to hear about your interest in making a difference in the world, especially at such a young age! Here are some steps you can take to start your journey towards promoting democracy and rule of law, and eventually becoming a lawyer:

1. **Learn and understand**: Start by learning about democracy, rule of law, and human rights. Read books, watch educational videos, and talk to your parents, teachers, and other adults about these topics. Some children's books that touch on these subjects include "The Little Book of Big Ideas" by Susan Hood, "The Story of an Idea: A Book About Freedom" bychristopher Cerf, and "The Rights of Kids" by James Solheim.

2. **Practice democracy at home and school**: Participate in decision-making processes at home and school. This could be as simple as helping to choose what's for dinner or suggesting ideas for a school project. This will help you understand how democracy works and give you a chance to practice your leadership skills.

3. **Respect rules and laws**: Understand that rules and laws are there to protect everyone's rights and keep society fair. Always follow the rules at home, school, and in your community. If you see someone breaking the rules, try to understand why and help them see the importance of following them.

This could be as simple as standing up for a friend who's being bullied or advocating for a classmate who's being left out. Remember, it's important to do this in a respectful and constructive way.

5. **Get involved in your community**: Look for opportunities to participate in community events and initiatives. This could be anything from helping with a local charity to joining a youth council or environmental group. This will give you a chance to
Q5_51_ I am 6 years old and from Portugal. I know not at all about Citizens’ dialogue, EU Youth Dialogue or EU Youth Conference. Can you tell me more about this? I am very curious to know more about this.

Dear friend,

I'm delighted to help you understand these important topics! Let's imagine we're having a conversation, and I'll explain them in a simple and fun way.

1. **Citizens' Dialogue**: Imagine you're in a big park with your friends, and you all want to decide what games to play. You can't just shout out your ideas and expect everyone to hear you, right? So, you gather in a circle, and each person takes a turn to share their idea. Everyone listens carefully, and then you all discuss which games you like the most. That's similar to a Citizens' Dialogue!

In the European Union (EU), a Citizens' Dialogue is when people from different countries come together to talk about important issues. They share their ideas, listen to each other, and discuss how to make things better. This helps the EU understand what people think and need, so they can make decisions that are good for everyone.

2. **EU Youth Dialogue**: Now, imagine you're in a school meeting, and you want to tell your teachers what you think about the school. You might have ideas about how to make recess more fun, or how to improve the school's garden. The EU Youth Dialogue is like this meeting, but with young people from all over Europe!

The EU Youth Dialogue is a way for young people like you to share your ideas and opinions about important things that affect your life. You can talk about what you think is important for your future, like education, jobs, or the environment. By doing this, you help the EU understand what young people need and want, so they can make decisions that are good for you and your friends.

3. **EU Youth Conference**: Finally, imagine you and your friends have been working on a big project together, like planting a community garden. After a lot of hard work, you all come together to show off what
Q5_52_ I am 6 years old and from Portugal. I know not at all about Public consultations. Can you tell me more about this? I would like to know what is a public consultation and how can I participate in it?

Hello! It's wonderful to hear from you. I'm here to help explain public consultations in a simple way.

A public consultation is like a big conversation where people from a community, like you and your family, friends, and neighbors, can share their thoughts and ideas about something important that's happening in your city, country, or even the world. It's a way for grown-ups who make decisions (like mayors, ministers, or even the United Nations) to listen to what kids and adults think.

Here's how you can participate in a public consultation:

1. **Find out about the consultation**: Ask your parents, teachers, or look online to find out if there are any public consultations happening in your area or about topics you care about. Sometimes, there might be posters in your school or community center.

2. **Learn about the topic**: Once you've found a consultation you're interested in, learn more about the topic. Ask your parents or teachers to help you understand what it's all about. For example, if it's about making a new park in your city, you might want to learn about why a park is important and what kind of park you'd like to have.

3. **Share your thoughts**: Now that you know about the topic, it's time to share your ideas! You can do this in different ways:
   - **Write a letter**: You can write a letter to the people organizing the consultation, telling them what you think. You can ask your parents or teachers to help you with this.
   - **Draw a picture**: If you're not sure how to write about your ideas, you can draw a picture instead. Sometimes, pictures can say a lot!
   - **Talk to someone**: If there's a meeting or event happening as part of the consultation, you can go with your parents and talk to the people there. They'll listen

Dear friend,

It's wonderful to hear that you're interested in learning more about the European Union (EU) at such a young age! The EU is a group of 27 countries that work together to make decisions and policies that affect their citizens. Here's a simple breakdown of how it works and some ways you can learn more about it:

1. **EU Institutions**: The EU has several institutions that help it function. Some of the most important ones are:

Hello! It's wonderful to hear from you. I'm here to help explain the European Youth Week and the European Youth Event in a way that's easy for you to understand.

1. **What is the European Youth Week?**
The European Youth Week is a special week dedicated to celebrating young people like you! It's a time when many countries in Europe organize activities and events to show how important young people are. These events can be about having fun, learning new things, or talking about important issues that affect young people. The European Youth Week usually happens in May.

2. **What is the European Youth Event (EYE)?**
The European Youth Event is a big event that happens every year in the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France. It's like a big party where young people from all over Europe can come together, meet each other, and talk about things that matter to them. There are games, workshops, and performances.

Q5_57_ I am 6 years old and from Portugal. I know a lot about Contacting a Commissioner or an MEP. Can you tell me more about this? I want to know more about the European Union.

Dear friend,

It's wonderful to hear that you're interested in learning more about the European Union (EU) at such a young age! I'm here to help you understand how the EU works and how you can get involved.

The European Union is a group of 27 countries that work together to make decisions and policies that affect their citizens. It was created to promote peace, stability, and cooperation among its member states. Here are some key aspects of the EU and how you can engage with it:

1. **European Commission**: The European Commission is the executive branch of the EU. It proposes new laws and policies, manages the EU's budget, and makes sure that EU laws are enforced. The Commission is led by a President and has 27 Commissioners, one from each member state. You can write to the Commissioners to share your ideas, ask questions, or express your concerns. Here's how you can do that:

   - Find the list of Commissioners and their portfolios: <https://ec.europa.eu/commission/president/commissioners_en>
   - Click on the Commissioner you want to contact and follow the instructions on their page to send a message.

2. **European Parliament**: The European Parliament is the legislative branch of the EU. It's made up of Members of the European Parliament (MEPs), who are elected every five years by EU citizens. MEPs represent EU citizens and have the power to pass laws and approve or reject the Commission's policies. You can contact your local MEP to share your thoughts on EU policies or ask them to raise issues in the Parliament. Here's how:

   - Find your local MEP: <https://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/search>

Q5_58_ I am 6 years old and from Portugal. I know not at all about Participation in events organised by the EU in your country. Can you tell me more about this?
Q5_59_ I am 6 years old and from Portugal. I know not at all about European Citizens’ Initiative. Can you tell me more about this? I want to know what it is and how it works.

Dear friend,

I'm delighted to help you understand the European Citizens' Initiative (ECI) in a simple and fun way!

Imagine you have a great idea that you think could make Europe a better place. The ECI is like a big suggestion box where you and other Europeans can put forward your ideas to change laws in the European Union (EU). It's a way for citizens like you to have a direct say in how the EU works.

Here's how it works in a few easy steps:

1. **Come up with an idea**: You or a group of people come up with a great idea for a new law or change to an existing one. This idea should be something that the EU can help with, like protecting the environment, improving life for animals, or making sure everyone has fair working conditions.

2. **Gather support**: To show that your idea is important to many people, you need to gather support from at least one million Europeans. But don't worry, you don't have to do this all by yourself! You can work with other people, organizations, or even use social media to spread the word.

3. **Follow the rules**: There are some rules to make sure the ECI works fairly for everyone. For example, you need to collect signatures from at least seven different EU countries, and you have one year to do this. Also, your idea should be something that the EU can legally do something about.

4. **Hand in your signatures**: Once you have collected at least one million signatures, you hand them in to the European Commission. This is like giving your idea to the people who make the laws in the EU.

5. **The European Commission responds**: The European Commission will check if your idea follows all the rules. If it does, they will give you a formal response within six months. They might decide to take action on your idea, or they might explain why they
