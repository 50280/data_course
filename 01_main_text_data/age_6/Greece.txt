Q5_51_ I am 6 years old and from Greece. I know not at all about Citizens’ dialogue, EU Youth Dialogue or EU Youth Conference. Can you tell me more about this? I am very curious to learn more about this.

Dear friend,

I'm delighted to help you understand these important topics! Let's imagine we're having a conversation, and I'll explain them in a simple and fun way.

1. **Citizens' Dialogue**: Imagine you're in a big park with your friends, and you all want to decide what games to play. You can't just shout out your ideas and expect everyone to hear you, right? So, you gather in a circle, and each person takes a turn to share their idea. Everyone listens carefully, and then you all discuss which games you like the most. That's similar to a Citizens' Dialogue!

In the EU, a Citizens' Dialogue is a meeting where people from different countries and backgrounds come together to talk about important topics. They share their ideas, listen to each other, and discuss how to make things better. The European Commission (that's like the grown-ups who help organize games in our park) organizes these dialogues to hear what people think about different subjects, like the environment, jobs, or how to make life better for everyone.

2. **EU Youth Dialogue**: Now, imagine you're in a school club, and you want to decide what activities to do. You and your friends have lots of great ideas, but you need to make sure everyone's voice is heard. So, you have a special meeting where each person can share their thoughts, and then you all vote on the best ideas. That's like the EU Youth Dialogue!

The EU Youth Dialogue is a special conversation between young people from all over Europe and the European Commission. It's a way for young people like you to share your ideas and opinions about things that matter to you, like education, jobs, or how to make your communities better. The European Commission listens to what you have to say and uses your ideas to help make decisions that affect young people.

3. **EU Youth Conference
Q5_52_ I am 6 years old and from Greece. I know not at all about Public consultations. Can you tell me more about this? I am very curious to learn about it.

Hello! It's wonderful to hear that you're curious about public consultations. I'll explain it in a simple way so that you can understand.

Public consultations are like big meetings where people from a community or a country can share their thoughts, ideas, and opinions about important decisions that the government or other big organizations want to make. These decisions can be about many things, like building new parks, changing rules for schools, or even how to make our cities better for everyone to live in.

Here's how it works:

1. **The Government or Organization Has a Plan**: Imagine you want to build a new playground in your neighborhood. You have a plan, but you want to know what other kids and their parents think about it.

2. **They Invite Everyone to Share Their Thoughts**: They announce that they're having a public consultation. They might put up posters, send emails, or even tell people through the news. They want as many people as possible to come and share their ideas.

3. **People Come and Talk**: On the day of the consultation, people come and talk about what they think. They might say things like, "I think the playground should have a slide," or "It would be great if there was a place for my mom to sit while I play."

4. **They Listen and Take Notes**: The people who are organizing the consultation listen carefully to what everyone is saying. They write down all the ideas and suggestions.

5. **They Make a Decision**: After they've heard from everyone, they use all the ideas they've collected to help them make a decision. They might decide to add a slide to the playground, or they might decide to add a bench for parents too.

6. **They Tell Everyone What Happened**: After the consultation, they tell everyone what they talked about and what decision they made. Sometimes, they even change their plan based on what they heard from the people.

So

Dear friend,

It's wonderful to hear that you're interested in learning more about the European Union (EU) at such a young age! The EU is a group of 27 countries that work together to make decisions and policies that affect their citizens. Here's a simple breakdown of how it works and some ways you can learn more about it:

1. **EU Institutions**: The EU has several institutions that help it function. Some of the most important ones are:
   - **European Parliament**: This is the EU's law-making body. It's made up of Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) who are elected by EU citizens every five years.
   - **European Commission**: This is the EU's executive body. It proposes new laws and makes sure that EU countries follow the rules.
   - **Council of the European Union**: This is where ministers from each EU country meet to discuss and agree on new laws and policies.
   - **European Council**: This is where the heads of state or government of the EU countries meet to provide the EU with its general political direction and priorities.

2. **EU Social Media Channels and Websites**: The EU has several online platforms where you can learn more about it and engage with other young people. Here are a few:

Q5_56_ I am 6 years old and from Greece. I know a little about The European Youth Week or the European Youth Event. Can you tell me more about this? What is it? What do young people do there? What is the purpose of this event?

The European Youth Week and the European Youth Event are initiatives organized by the European Union to engage and involve young people in the democratic life of Europe. Here's a simple explanation for you:

1. **European Youth Week**: This is a week-long event that happens every year in May. It's like a big party where young people from all over Europe come together to celebrate their diversity, share their ideas, and learn about each other's cultures. During this week, there are many activities like workshops, games, concerts, and discussions. Young people can talk about things that are important to them, like the environment, education, or their future. The purpose of the European Youth Week is to make young people feel more connected to Europe and to encourage them to participate in shaping their future.

2. **European Youth Event (EYE)**: This is a bigger event that happens every two years in the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France. It's like a big meeting where young people from all over Europe come together to discuss and debate about important topics. They can meet with Members of the European Parliament, share their ideas, and even vote on resolutions. The purpose of the EYE is to give young people a voice in European politics and to show them that their opinions matter.

In both events, young people can learn about how the European Union works, meet new friends from other countries, and have fun while doing it. It's a great opportunity for them to express their views, learn from each other, and become more active citizens in Europe.

Here's a fun fact: The European Youth Week and the European Youth Event are organized by the European Parliament, which is the democratically elected body of the European Union. It's like the parliament in your country, but for all the countries in the European Union!

Q5_59_ I am 6 years old and from Greece. I know not at all about European Citizens’ Initiative. Can you tell me more about this? I want to know what it is and how it works.

Dear friend,

I'm glad you're interested in learning about the European Citizens' Initiative (ECI)! I'll explain it in a simple way, just for you.

1. **What is the European Citizens' Initiative?**
   Imagine you have an idea that you think could make Europe a better place. The ECI is like a big suggestion box for European citizens. It's a way for people like you and me to tell the European Commission (that's like the government of Europe) about our ideas and ask them to make new laws.

2. **Who can start an ECI?**
   To start an ECI, you need to be a citizen of one of the European Union countries, and you need to be at least 18 years old. You also need to gather a group of people from at least 7 different EU countries to support your idea.

3. **How does it work?**
   - **Step 1: Collect signatures.** You and your group need to collect at least 1 million signatures from citizens of at least 7 different EU countries. This shows that many people support your idea.
   - **Step 2: Check the signatures.** The European Commission checks if the signatures are real and come from different countries.
   - **Step 3: The Commission decides.** If your ECI has enough valid signatures, the European Commission will decide if they want to make a new law based on your idea. They can also say why they don't want to make the law.
   - **Step 4: The European Parliament and Council decide.** If the Commission likes your idea, they will propose a new law. Then, the European Parliament and Council will decide if they want to make the law or not.

4. **What kind of ideas can you suggest?**
   You can suggest ideas about many things, like the environment, human rights, or how to make Europe a
