Q4b_46_ I am 6 years old and from Germany. I am a little interested in changing society in the area of Wars and conflicts. Can you tell me how I can do this? I want to help people who are in danger.

Dear friend,

It's wonderful to hear that you're already thinking about how to make the world a better place, especially at such a young age. Here are some ways you can start making a difference, even at 6 years old:

1. **Learn and Understand**: The first step is to learn more about the issues you're interested in. You can ask your parents or teachers to help you understand why wars and conflicts happen, and how they affect people. There are many age-appropriate books, games, and videos that can help you learn about these topics.

2. **Share What You've Learned**: Once you understand more about these issues, you can share what you've learned with others. You can talk to your friends, family, and even your classmates about what you've learned. You might inspire others to care about these issues too!

3. **Be Kind and Compassionate**: Treat everyone with kindness and respect. This might seem small, but it's a big part of creating a more peaceful world. When you grow up, you can set a positive example for others and help to create a more compassionate society.

4. **Help Others**: Even at your age, there are many ways you can help others. You can donate some of your toys or books to children who don't have as much as you do. You can also help out at home by doing chores and helping your family.

5. **Write Letters or Draw Pictures**: You can write letters or draw pictures to show your support for people who are going through tough times. You can send these to organizations that help people in need, or to people you know who are helping others.

6. **Participate in Fundraisers or Charity Events**: When you're a bit older, you can participate in fundraisers or charity events to raise money for organizations that help people affected by wars and conflicts.

7. **Grow Up
Q4b_47_ I am 6 years old and from Germany. I am a little interested in changing society in the area of Democracy and rule of law. Can you tell me how I can do this? I want to be a lawyer when I grow up.

Dear young friend,

It's wonderful to hear about your interest in making a difference in society, especially at such a young age! Here are some steps you can take to start your journey towards promoting democracy and rule of law, and eventually becoming a lawyer:

1. **Learn and understand**: Start by learning about democracy, rule of law, and human rights. Read books, watch educational videos, and talk to your parents, teachers, and other adults about these topics. Some children's books that might help include "The Little Book of Big Ideas" by Susan Hood and "Democracy" by Kim Doner.

2. **Ask questions**: Don't be afraid to ask questions about the world around you. This will help you understand how things work and where you might want to make a difference.

3. **Participate in school activities**: Join school clubs or groups that focus on social issues, human rights, or environmental causes. This will give you hands-on experience in making a difference and working with others.

4. **Help in your community**: Look for ways to help in your local community. This could be anything from volunteering at a local charity, helping with community clean-up efforts, or participating in community meetings to share your ideas.

5. **Write letters or start a blog**: You can write letters to local politicians, newspaper editors, or other influential people to share your thoughts on important issues. Alternatively, you could start a blog or a YouTube channel to share your ideas with a wider audience.

6. **Educate others**: Share what you've learned with your friends, family, and classmates. You can organize presentations, create posters, or even start a small club focused on democracy and rule of law.

7. **Study hard**: To become a lawyer, you'll need to do well in school, especially in subjects like history, social studies, and languages. Also, make sure to read a lot
Q5_51_ I am 6 years old and from Germany. I know not at all about Citizens’ dialogue, EU Youth Dialogue or EU Youth Conference. Can you tell me more about this? I am very curious.

Hello! It's great to hear that you're curious about these topics. I'll explain them in a simple way that's easy for a 6-year-old to understand.

1. **Citizens' Dialogue**: Imagine you're in a big playground with many children from different countries. You all want to talk about how to make the playground better for everyone. So, you gather in a circle and each child gets a turn to share their ideas. The grown-ups who take care of the playground also listen and ask questions. This is similar to a Citizens' Dialogue, but instead of a playground, it's about the European Union (EU), which is like a big group of countries that work together. People from these countries get together to talk about how to make the EU better for everyone.

2. **EU Youth Dialogue**: Now, imagine you're in a special part of the playground just for kids your age. You all want to talk about things that are important to you, like what games to play or how to make the playground more fun. You share your ideas and listen to what others have to say. The grown-ups who take care of the playground also listen and try to help make your ideas happen. The EU Youth Dialogue is like this, but it's for young people from the EU countries. They talk about things that are important to them, like education, jobs, and how to make their voices heard.

3. **EU Youth Conference**: This is like a big party in the playground where kids from all over the world are invited. You all get together to talk about the things you've been discussing in your own parts of the playground. You share your ideas and listen to what others have been talking about. It's a chance to meet new friends and learn about different cultures. The EU Youth Conference is like this, but it's a big event where young people from the EU and other countries come together to talk about the future
Q5_52_ I am 6 years old and from Germany. I know not at all about Public consultations. Can you tell me more about this? I am very curious.

Hello! It's wonderful to hear that you're curious about public consultations. I'll explain it in a simple way so that you can understand.

A public consultation is like a big conversation between people and the people who make rules or decisions for a city, country, or even the whole world. It's a way for everyone to have a say in what happens in their community or the world.

Imagine you're in a classroom, and the teacher wants to decide on a new game for recess. The teacher could just pick a game on their own, but that might not be fair because some kids might not like that game. So, the teacher asks everyone in the class what games they like, and then they all talk about it together. That's a bit like a public consultation!

In a public consultation, grown-ups who make decisions (like politicians, or people who work for the government) ask everyone in the community what they think about a certain topic. They might want to know if people like or dislike an idea, or if they have any good suggestions to make things better.

For example, let's say the city wants to build a new playground. They might have a public consultation to ask people:

1. Where they think the playground should be built.
2. What kind of equipment they want in the playground.
3. If they have any ideas to make the playground fun and safe for everyone.

People can share their thoughts by filling out a form, talking to the people who are organizing the consultation, or even drawing pictures if they're too young to write. This way, everyone's voice is heard, and the city can make a decision that most people will be happy with.

So, public consultations are like big, important conversations that help make sure everyone has a say in what happens in their community. It's a great way for people to work together and make things better!
Q5_53_ I am 6 years old and from Germany. I know kind of about European elections. Can you tell me more about this? What are they and why are they important?

Dear friend,

I'm delighted to help you understand the European elections! Let's imagine you're in a big school called Europe, where many countries come together to learn, play, and grow. The European Union (EU) is like the student council of this school, and the European elections are when all the students (citizens of EU countries) vote for who they want to represent them in this council.

1. **What are European elections?**
   - They are a chance for citizens of the European Union to vote for Members of the European Parliament (MEPs). These MEPs then form the European Parliament, which is one of the main decision-making bodies in the EU, along with the Council of the European Union and the European Commission.
   - Elections happen every five years, and they take place in all EU countries on the same weekend. This year, they will happen from May 23 to 26, 2024.

2. **Why are European elections important?**
   - **Choosing our representatives**: European elections give you and other citizens a say in who will represent you and your country in the European Parliament. These MEPs will make decisions that affect your life, like rules about the environment, trade, and travel within the EU.
   - **Shaping Europe's future**: The European Parliament has the power to approve or reject new laws and the EU budget. By voting, you're helping to decide what kind of Europe you want to live in – one that prioritizes things like sustainability, innovation, or social justice.
   - **Making your voice heard**: Voting is a way to express your opinions and concerns. It shows the EU and your national government what's important to you and your fellow citizens.
   - **Learning about democracy**: Participating in elections helps you understand how democracy works. It teaches you about the importance of having a say in the decisions that affect your life and the
Q5_54_ I am 6 years old and from Germany. I know a little about EU social media channels and websites (i.e. European Youth Portal). Can you tell me more about this? I am interested in learning more about the EU.

2. **EU on Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/EUinmyregion/)**
   - The EU has an official Facebook page where they share news, stories, and interesting facts about the EU and its member countries.
   - They also have a page called "EU in my region" which focuses on regional news and initiatives.

3. **EU on Twitter (https://twitter.com/EU_Commission)**
   - The EU's official Twitter account shares updates, news, and information about EU policies and activities.
   - They also have accounts for different EU institutions and topics, like @EU_Commission (European Commission), @EUCouncil (Council of the EU), and @EUCitizens (EU Citizens' Rights).

4. **EU on Instagram (https://www.instagram.com/europeanunion/)**
   - The EU's Instagram account shares beautiful photos and stories from across Europe, highlighting the diversity and richness of the continent.

Q5_57_ I am 6 years old and from Germany. I know a lot about Contacting a Commissioner or an MEP. Can you tell me more about this? I want to know more about the European Union and how it works.

Hello! It's wonderful to hear that you're interested in learning about the European Union (EU) and how it works. I'll do my best to explain it in a way that's easy for you to understand.

1. **What is the European Union?**
The European Union is like a big club of countries that work together. It started with just 6 countries, and now there are 27. They all agree to follow certain rules and help each other out. This makes it easier for people, goods, and services to move between the countries.

2. **What does the EU do?**
The EU does many things to make life better for the people who live in its countries. Some of the things it does include:
   - Making sure there are rules to protect the environment and keep people safe.
   - Helping farmers and fishermen.
   - Making it easier for people to travel and work in other EU countries.
   - Working together to keep the peace and solve problems.

3. **Who makes the rules?**
The EU has its own parliament, called the European Parliament. It's like the parliament in your country, but for the whole EU. There are also a President of the European Commission and a President of the European Council.

4. **What are Commissioners and MEPs?**
- **Commissioners** are like the ministers in your country's government. They are in charge of different areas, like the environment, economy, or agriculture. There is one Commissioner from each EU country.
- **MEPs** stand for Members of the European Parliament. They are elected by the people in the EU countries to represent them in the European Parliament. They vote on new laws and make sure the Commissioners are doing their jobs properly.

5. **How can I contact a Commissioner or an MEP?**
If you have something you'd like to say to a Commissioner or an

Q5_59_ I am 6 years old and from Germany. I know a little about European Citizens’ Initiative. Can you tell me more about this? What is it and how does it work?

Hello! It's great to hear that you're interested in learning about the European Citizens’ Initiative (ECI). I'll do my best to explain it in a simple way that's easy for a 6-year-old to understand.

Imagine you have a big idea that you think could make Europe a better place. The ECI is like a special way for you and other kids (and grown-ups) from all over Europe to tell the European Union (EU) about your idea. The EU is like a big club that many countries in Europe belong to, and they work together to make rules that affect everyone in those countries.

Here's how the ECI works:

1. **Collect signatures**: First, you need to find other people who like your idea and want to support it. You need to collect at least one million signatures from at least seven different EU countries. This is like asking your friends and family to agree with you and sign a big piece of paper.

2. **Check the signatures**: The EU will check if the signatures are real and come from different countries. If there are enough signatures, your idea will be looked at by the European Commission. The European Commission is like the group of people who help run the EU.

3. **The European Commission decides**: The European Commission will decide if they can do something about your idea. If they think it's a good idea and they can make it happen, they will try to turn it into a real law or rule for Europe.

4. **Everyone votes**: If the European Commission can't make your idea into a law, they have to explain why. Then, the European Parliament (which is like a big group of elected representatives from all the EU countries) and the Council of the EU (which is like a group of ministers from each EU country) can decide if they want to try to make your idea into a law.

So, the ECI is like a way for
