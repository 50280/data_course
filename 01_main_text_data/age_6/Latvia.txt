Q4b_41_ I am 6 years old and from Latvia. I am a little interested in changing society in the area of Climate change and environmental protection. Can you tell me how I can do this? I want to do something good for the world.

Hello! It's wonderful to hear that you're already thinking about how to make a positive impact on the world at such a young age. Here are some simple and age-appropriate ways you can help make a difference in the area of climate change and environmental protection:

1. **Learn More**: Start by learning more about climate change and environmental issues. You can ask your parents or teachers to help you find age-appropriate books, videos, or websites that explain these topics in a way that's easy to understand.

2. **Reduce, Reuse, Recycle**: This is a great way to start making a difference. Here's how you can do it:
   - **Reduce**: Try to use less. For example, turn off lights when you leave a room, or ask your parents to help you turn off electronic devices when they're not in use.

5. **Save Energy**: Turn off lights and electronics when you're not using them. You can also ask your parents to help you use energy-efficient light bulbs.

Q4b_44_ I am 6 years old and from Latvia. I am a little interested in changing society in the area of Equal rights regardless of gender, race or sexuality. Can you tell me how I can do this? I want to be a leader in this area.

Dear friend,

It's wonderful to hear about your passion for equality and your desire to make a difference in the world. At your age, you have a unique opportunity to learn, grow, and start making a positive impact. Here are some steps you can take to become a leader in promoting equal rights:

1. **Educate Yourself**: Learn about different forms of equality, such as gender equality, racial equality, and LGBTQ+ rights. Read books, watch age-appropriate documentaries, and talk to your parents, teachers, and other trusted adults about these topics. The more you understand, the better you can advocate for others.

2. **Start at Home and School**: Begin by promoting equality in your own life. Treat everyone with kindness and respect, regardless of their gender, race, or who they love. At home, you can talk to your family about the importance of equality. At school, you can be a role model for your peers and stand up for others if you see them being treated unfairly.

3. **Spread Awareness**: Share what you've learned with others. You can do this by:
   - **Talking** to your friends, family, and classmates about equality.
   - **Writing** about it. You could start a blog, write a story, or create a comic strip that promotes equality.
   - **Creating Art** that represents diversity and equality. This could be a painting, a drawing, or even a dance performance.
   - **Using Social Media** (with your parents' permission and supervision) to share your thoughts and ideas. You could start a page or a group dedicated to promoting equality.

4. **Join or Start a Club**: See if there's a club or group at your school that focuses on social justice or equality. If there isn't, you could start one with the help of a teacher or parent. This can be a great way to connect

Q5_52_ I am 6 years old and from Latvia. I know not at all about Public consultations. Can you tell me more about this? I am very curious.

Hello! It's wonderful to hear that you're curious about public consultations. I'll explain it in a simple way so that you can understand.

Public consultations are like big meetings where people from a city, town, or country can share their thoughts and ideas about important decisions that the government or other big organizations want to make. These decisions can be about many things, like building new parks, changing rules for traffic, or even how to make the city a better place to live.

Here's how it works:

1. **The Government or Organization Has an Idea**: They think of a new plan or change that they want to make. For example, they might want to build a new playground in your neighborhood.

2. **They Tell Everyone**: They announce that they have this idea and they want to hear what people think about it. They might put up posters, send emails, or even put it on the news so that everyone knows about it.

3. **People Share Their Thoughts**: This is where the consultation part comes in. Anyone can share their thoughts, ideas, or concerns about the plan. They might say things like, "I think the playground is a great idea!" or "I'm worried that the playground will be too noisy at night."

4. **The Government or Organization Listens**: They listen to what everyone has to say. They might even change their plan based on what they've heard.

5. **They Make a Decision**: After listening to everyone, they make a decision about what to do. Sometimes, they might decide to go ahead with their plan, but other times, they might change it based on what people said.

So, public consultations are a way for grown-ups to make sure that everyone has a say in important decisions. It's like a big conversation where everyone can share their thoughts and ideas.

Q5_59_ I am 6 years old and from Latvia. I know not at all about European Citizens’ Initiative. Can you tell me more about this? What is it? What can I do with it?

Hello! It's great to hear that you're interested in learning about the European Citizens’ Initiative (ECI). I'll explain it in a simple way that's easy for a 6-year-old to understand.

Imagine you have a big idea that you think could make Europe a better place. The ECI is like a special way for you to tell the European Commission, which is like the grown-ups who help make rules for Europe, about your big idea. They might listen to you and maybe even make a new rule based on your idea!

Here's how it works:

1. **Collect signatures**: First, you need to find other people in Europe who like your idea. You'll need to collect signatures from at least one million people from at least seven different European countries. This is like asking your friends and family to support your idea.

2. **Write a proposal**: You need to write a proposal explaining your idea and why it's important. It's like writing a letter to the European Commission, telling them why you think your idea is great.

3. **The European Commission decides**: After you've collected all the signatures and written your proposal, the European Commission will look at your idea. If they think it's a good one, they might start working on making a new rule based on your idea.

4. **You can help**: Even though you're 6 years old, you can still help! You can talk to your parents, teachers, and friends about your idea. You can also help collect signatures by asking people you know to support your idea.

So, the ECI is like a way for you to have a big voice and help make Europe a better place. It's important to remember that you need to be at least 18 years old to start an ECI, but you can still help and learn about it now.

Keep being curious and asking questions! That's how you'll learn more
