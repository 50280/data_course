These could be organized by your school, local government, or community organizations. You can ask your parents, teachers, or other adults you trust to help you find out about these events.

2. **Online Platforms**: Many organizations now offer online activities and events due to the pandemic. This means you can participate from the comfort of your own home. Some examples include:
   - UNICEF's Kid Power: https://www.unicef.org/kidpower
   - Amnesty International's Youth Activist Network: https://www.amnesty.org/en/what-we-do/youth-activism/
   - The World's Largest Lesson: https://www.theworldslargestlesson.globalgoals.org/

3. **School Council or Student Council**: If your school has a council where students can voice their opinions and ideas, ask your parents or teachers to help you get involved. If your school doesn't have one, maybe you could start one!

4. **Write Letters or Petitions**: You can write letters to local politicians, or even the Prime Minister, to share your thoughts and ideas about issues that matter to you. You can also start or sign petitions online. Websites like Change.org make it easy for anyone to start a petition.

5. **Volunteer**: Look for local volunteering opportunities. This could be anything from helping at a local charity shop, to cleaning up a park, or visiting an elderly neighbor. Volunteering is a great way to make a difference in your community.

4. **Protect Wildlife**: You can help protect local wildlife by creating a safe space for them in your backyard. This could be as simple as putting out a bird feeder or creating a small pond. You can also participate in local clean-up efforts to remove litter that could harm animals.

Hello! It's wonderful to hear that you're already thinking about how to make the world a better place, especially in the area of health and well-being. Here are some simple ways you can start making a difference, even at your young age:

1. **Learn and Share**: Start by learning about health and well-being. You can ask your parents, teachers, or even look up simple, age-appropriate information online.

2. **Help at Home**: You can help your parents or guardians with simple tasks around the house that promote health and well-being. This could be setting the table for healthy meals, helping with laundry (especially your own clothes to keep them clean), or even helping to tidy up your room to keep it clean and organized.

3. **Be Kind**: Show kindness and compassion to others. This can make a big difference in their well-being. You can do this by sharing your toys, helping a friend who's feeling sad, or including everyone in your games at school.

5. **Fundraising**: If you're interested in raising money for a cause, you could start small by asking your family and friends to sponsor you for a challenge, like reading a certain number of books or learning a new skill. You could then donate the money to a charity that supports health and well-being.

6. **Write to Leaders**: You can write letters to local leaders, like your mayor or a member of parliament, to share your ideas about how to improve health and well-being in your community. They might be inspired by your passion and

Q4b_47_ I am 6 years old and from Poland. I am a little interested in changing society in the area of Democracy and rule of law. Can you tell me how I can do this? I want to be a lawyer when I grow up.

Dear young friend,

It's wonderful to hear about your interest in making a difference in society, especially at such a young age! Here are some steps you can take to start your journey towards promoting democracy and rule of law, and eventually becoming a lawyer:

1. **Learn and understand**: Start by learning about democracy, rule of law, and human rights. Read books, watch educational videos, and talk to your parents, teachers, and other adults about these topics. Some children's books that touch on these subjects include "The Little Book of Big Ideas" by Susan Hood and "The Story of an Idea: A Book About Freedom" bychristopher Nibble.

2. **Practice democracy at home and school**: Participate in decision-making processes at home and school. This could be as simple as helping to choose what's for dinner or suggesting ideas for a school project. This will help you understand how democracy works and give you practical experience.

3. **Respect rules and laws**: Understand that rules and laws are there to protect everyone's rights and ensure fairness. Always follow them, and encourage your friends to do the same. This will help you appreciate the importance of rule of law.

4. **Stand up for what's right**: If you see something unfair or wrong, don't hesitate to speak up. This could be at school, in your neighborhood, or even within your family. Remember, it's important to do this in a respectful and constructive way.

5. **Help others**: Look for opportunities to help people in your community. This could be through volunteering, participating in community service projects, or simply helping a neighbor in need. This will give you a sense of how you can contribute to society and make it a better place.

6. **Develop your skills**: As you grow older, focus on developing skills that will be useful in your future career as a lawyer. These include
Q5_51_ I am 6 years old and from Poland. I know not at all about Citizens’ dialogue, EU Youth Dialogue or EU Youth Conference. Can you tell me more about this? I am very curious.

Dear friend,

I'm glad you're curious about these topics! Let's imagine you're in a big playground called Europe, where many children from different countries come to play together. This playground has some special rules and activities that make it fun for everyone.

1. **Citizens' Dialogue**: Imagine you're playing with your friends, and sometimes you have disagreements about how to play a game or share toys. To solve these issues, you all sit down and talk about your ideas and feelings. You listen to each other and try to find a solution that makes everyone happy. That's similar to a Citizens' Dialogue. In this case, grown-ups from different European countries get together to talk about important topics, like how to make the playground (Europe) a better place for everyone. They share their ideas and listen to each other, just like you and your friends do when you play together.

2. **EU Youth Dialogue**: Now, imagine there's a special club in the playground where only children can go. In this club, you can talk about things that are important to you, like how to make the playground more fun, or how to help other children who might be feeling left out. The grown-ups listen to what you have to say and try to help you make changes. The EU Youth Dialogue is like this club. It's a place where young people from all over Europe can come together to talk about issues that matter to them, like education, jobs, or the environment. They share their ideas and suggestions with the grown-ups, who then try to make these ideas a reality.

3. **EU Youth Conference**: Finally, imagine that once a year, the playground organizes a big party where all the children can come together to celebrate and talk about the things they've achieved throughout the year. They can also share their ideas for the future and plan new activities. The EU Youth Conference is like this party. It's an annual event
Q5_52_ I am 6 years old and from Poland. I know a little about Public consultations. Can you tell me more about this? What is it?

A public consultation is a process where people are invited to share their thoughts, ideas, and opinions on a particular topic or issue. It's like a big conversation where everyone can have a say. Here are some simple steps to understand how it works:

1. **Someone wants to know what you think**: This could be your school, your local government, or even a big company. They have a question or an idea they want to share with you, and they want to hear your thoughts.

2. **They tell you about it**: They might send you a letter, put up posters, or share information online. They'll explain what they want to talk about and how you can give your feedback.

3. **You share your thoughts**: You can tell them what you think about the topic. You can agree or disagree with their idea, or you can suggest something new. There's no right or wrong answer, it's just about sharing your opinion.

4. **They listen and take note**: The people organizing the consultation will listen to what you and others have to say. They might ask more questions or clarify some points.

5. **They use your feedback**: After the consultation, they'll use the feedback they've received to help them make a decision or plan something. They might tell you how they used your feedback, or they might just use it to help them understand what people think.

So, a public consultation is a way for people to have a say in things that affect them. It's a way to make sure that everyone's voice is heard. It's like a big conversation where everyone can join in and share their thoughts.

Q5_58_ I am 6 years old and from Poland. I know not at all about Participation in events organised by the EU in your country. Can you tell me more about this?
Q5_59_ I am 6 years old and from Poland. I know not at all about European Citizens’ Initiative. Can you tell me more about this? I am very curious.

Dear friend,

I'm glad you're curious about the European Citizens' Initiative (ECI)! Let's imagine you're playing a game with your friends. In this game, you all have an equal say in how the game is played, and you can suggest new rules or changes to the game. The ECI is a bit like that, but for the European Union (EU), which is like a big group of countries playing together.

Here's a simple breakdown:

1. **What is the European Citizens' Initiative?**
   The ECI is a way for citizens of the EU to suggest new laws or changes to existing ones. It's a tool for you and other Europeans to have a direct say in how the EU works.

2. **How does it work?**
   - First, a group of at least 7 European citizens from at least 7 different EU countries come together to propose a new law or change to an existing one. They write a proposal and register it with the European Commission.
   - Then, they need to collect signatures from at least 1 million Europeans who support their idea. These signatures must come from at least 7 different EU countries, and the number of signatures from each country should be proportional to the size of that country's population.
   - Once the initiative collects enough signatures, the European Commission will decide whether to take action on the proposal. If they do, they might propose a new law or change to the European Parliament and the Council of the EU.

3. **What kind of things can you suggest?**
   You can suggest changes to almost any area that the EU has the power to make laws about. This could be things like the environment, energy, transport, or even how the EU itself works. However, you can't use the ECI to suggest changes to things like tax laws, foreign policy, or the EU's budget.

4. **Why is it important?**
   The ECI
