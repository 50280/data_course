It is difficult to get there from my home  (e.g. by public transport). For my friends, this is a lot the same. Can you tell me more about how I can do that? I would like to participate in democratic activities.

Dear friend,

It's wonderful to hear that you're interested in participating in democratic activities! Even though you might face some challenges due to distance, there are still many ways you can get involved and have your voice heard. Here are some suggestions:

1. **Local Activities**: Start by looking for local events and activities in your area. These could be meetings, workshops, or events organized by your municipality or local community groups. They might be held in schools, community centers, or other nearby locations. You can ask your parents, teachers, or local officials to help you find out about these events.

2. **Online Participation**: Many democratic processes and discussions now happen online. This means you can participate from the comfort of your own home. Here are a few ways you can do this:

   - **Webinars and Online Meetings**: Some organizations host online meetings or webinars where you can listen to discussions and sometimes even ask questions.

   - **Online Petitions and Surveys**: You can sign online petitions or fill out surveys to show your support for certain issues. Websites like Change.org or Avaaz often have petitions started by children and teens.

   - **Social Media**: Platforms like Twitter and Facebook often have discussions about current events and democratic processes. You can join these conversations by creating an account (with your parents' permission and supervision) and sharing your thoughts.

3. **School Activities**: Your school might have clubs or groups that focus on democracy, social issues, or current events. These can be a great way to learn more and have your voice heard. If your school doesn't have any, you could start your own club with the help of your teachers.

4. **Write Letters or Emails**: You can write letters or emails to your local representatives, such as your mayor or members of parliament. They represent you and it's their job to listen to your concerns and ideas. You can ask your

Q4b_43_ I am 6 years old and from Denmark. I am not at all interested in changing society in the area of Economic inequality and welfare expenditure. Can you tell me how I can do this? I want to do something good for the world.

I'm glad to hear that you're interested in making a positive impact on the world, even at a young age! Here are some age-appropriate ways you can contribute to reducing economic inequality and promoting welfare expenditure:

1. **Learn and Understand**: Start by learning about these topics. You can ask your parents, teachers, or look for simple, age-appropriate books and videos online that explain economic inequality and welfare expenditure in a way that's easy to understand.

2. **Share What You've Learned**: Once you understand these concepts, share what you've learned with your friends, family, and classmates. You can do this through conversations, drawings, or even a simple presentation at school.

3. **Help Others**: Look for ways to help others in your community. This could be as simple as helping a neighbor with their groceries, or participating in community service projects at your school or local charity. Here are a few ideas:

   - **Food Banks**: Help collect and sort food for your local food bank. This can help reduce hunger in your community.

   - **Clothing and Toy Drives**: Collect clothes and toys that you no longer need and donate them to those who might need them more.

   - **Fundraising**: Organize a small fundraiser for a cause you care about. This could be a lemonade stand, a bake sale, or a car wash. The money you raise can go towards helping others.

4. **Write Letters**: Write letters to your local politicians or leaders about the issues you care about. You can ask them to do more to help reduce economic inequality and increase welfare expenditure.

5. **Plant Trees or Clean Up Your Community**: These activities might not directly reduce economic inequality, but they help create a cleaner, greener world for everyone, regardless of their economic status.

6. **Be Kind and Inclusive**: Treat everyone with kindness and respect. This includes
Q4b_44_ I am 6 years old and from Denmark. I am a little interested in changing society in the area of Equal rights regardless of gender, race or sexuality. Can you tell me how I can do this? I want to do something good for the world.

Thank you for your question! It's wonderful to hear that you're already thinking about how to make the world a better place. Here are some age-appropriate ways you can start making a difference:

1. **Learn and Understand**: Start by learning about different cultures, races, and genders. This will help you understand why equality is important. You can ask your parents, teachers, or librarians to help you find books, videos, or other resources that explain these topics in an age-appropriate way.

2. **Be Kind and Inclusive**: Treat everyone with kindness and respect, regardless of their differences. This includes your friends, classmates, and even people you don't know very well. If you see someone being left out, invite them to join in. Remember, everyone deserves to feel included and valued.

3. **Stand Up for Others**: If you see someone being treated unfairly, it's important to stand up for them. This could be as simple as telling a teacher if you see someone being bullied, or telling an adult if you hear someone making hurtful comments.

4. **Spread Awareness**: You can help spread awareness about equality by talking to your friends and family about what you've learned. You can also create posters or drawings that promote equality and hang them up at home or school.

5. **Participate in Community Events**: Look for local events that promote equality, such as pride parades, cultural festivals, or charity walks. These events can be a fun way to show your support and learn more about different communities.

6. **Fundraise or Donate**: If you have pocket money or birthday money, you could choose to donate some of it to a charity that supports equality. You could also organize a small fundraiser, like a lemonade stand or a bake sale, with the proceeds going to a good cause.

7. **Write to Leaders**: You can write letters

Q4b_46_ I am 6 years old and from Denmark. I am a little interested in changing society in the area of Wars and conflicts. Can you tell me how I can do this? I want to help people in the world.

Dear little friend,

It's wonderful to hear that you're already thinking about how to make the world a better place. Here are some simple ways you can help, even at your young age:

1. **Learn and Understand**: Start by learning about different countries, cultures, and the reasons why conflicts happen. This will help you understand the issues better and know how to talk about them with others.

2. **Share Your Knowledge**: Tell your friends, family, and teachers about what you've learned. You can share stories, draw pictures, or even make a presentation at school. The more people know, the more they can care and help.

3. **Be Kind and Compassionate**: Treat everyone with kindness and respect, no matter where they come from or what they believe in. This can help to build bridges between people and show that we're all more alike than different.

4. **Write Letters or Draw Pictures**: You can write letters or draw pictures to show your support for people affected by wars and conflicts. You can send these to organizations that help these people, or to leaders who can make changes.

5. **Fundraise**: If you have a birthday coming up, you could ask for donations to a charity that helps people in need instead of gifts. You could also organize a small fundraiser, like a lemonade stand or a bake sale, with the money going to a good cause.

6. **Pray or Send Good Thoughts**: If you believe in a higher power, you can pray for peace and for the people affected by wars. If you don't, you can still send good thoughts and wishes their way.

7. **Support Organizations**: There are many organizations that work to help people affected by wars and conflicts, and to promote peace. You can support them by donating money (if you have some of your own) or by encouraging others to support them.

8. **Grow Up

Q5_51_ I am 6 years old and from Denmark. I know a lot about Citizens’ dialogue, EU Youth Dialogue or EU Youth Conference. Can you tell me more about this? I am very interested in this.

Dear friend,

It's wonderful to hear that you're interested in learning more about the EU Youth Dialogue and Citizens' Dialogues! I'll do my best to explain these in a way that's easy for you to understand.

1. **EU Youth Dialogue**: This is like a big conversation between young people and the European Union (EU) about what's important to you. The EU wants to know what you think about different topics, like education, jobs, or the environment, so they can make decisions that are better for young people like you.

Here's how it works:

- Young people from all over Europe, including Denmark, can share their ideas and opinions through online surveys, workshops, or events.
- These ideas are then collected and discussed at a special meeting called the EU Youth Conference. This is where young people from different countries come together to talk about the most important issues.
- After the conference, the EU listens to what you've said and tries to make changes that will help young people.

2. **Citizens' Dialogues**: These are conversations between EU leaders and citizens, like you and your family. The EU wants to hear what people from all over Europe think about different EU policies and decisions. This helps them understand what's important to you and your family.

Here's how it works:

- EU leaders, like the President of the European Commission or the President of the European Parliament, travel to different countries to meet with citizens.
- They organize events where people can ask questions, share their thoughts, and discuss different topics.
- The EU leaders listen to what people have to say and try to answer their questions as best they can.

Both the EU Youth Dialogue and Citizens' Dialogues are really important because they give you and other young people a chance to have your voice heard. It's like a big conversation where you can share your ideas and help shape the future of Europe.

If you want to get involved,

Q5_53_ I am 6 years old and from Denmark. I know a little about European elections. Can you tell me more about this? What is it and why is it important?

Dear friend,

I'm delighted to help you understand the European elections! Let's imagine you're in a big playground called Europe, where many children from different countries play together. The European elections are like choosing the playground monitors, who will help make sure everyone plays fair and has a good time.

1. **What are the European elections?**
   The European elections are a chance for people like you, who live in the countries of the European Union (EU), to vote for who they want to represent them in the European Parliament. The European Parliament is like the school council of the EU, where people from different countries come together to make decisions that affect everyone in the EU.

2. **Why are they important?**
   The European elections are important for several reasons:

   - **Making decisions together**: The EU is a group of countries that work together on many things, like trade, travel, and protecting the environment. The European Parliament helps make sure that the rules and decisions are fair and benefit everyone in the EU.

   - **Choosing the European Commission**: After the European elections, the members of the European Parliament help choose the President of the European Commission, which is like the head teacher of the EU. The President then picks other commissioners to help run the EU.

   - **Having a say in laws**: The European Parliament works together with the Council of the EU (which represents the governments of the member countries) to make new laws and change existing ones. These laws can affect many aspects of our lives, like how we travel, what we eat, and how we protect our environment.

   - **Showing what we care about**: When we vote, we're showing what's important to us. This can help the people we elect to represent us in the European Parliament make decisions that reflect our priorities.

3. **How do the elections work?**
   In the European elections, you can vote for a list of candidates

Q5_58_ I am 6 years old and from Denmark. I know  about Participation in events organised by the EU in your country. Can you tell me more about this? What are the events and how can I participate?

Participation in events organised by the EU in your country can be a great way to learn more about the European Union and its values, as well as to engage with other young people from across Europe. Here are some types of events that you might be interested in:

1. **EUROPEAN YOUTH EVENTS**: These are large-scale events organised by the European Commission's Directorate-General for Education, Youth, Sport and Culture. They bring together young people from all over Europe to discuss and debate topics such as democracy, human rights, and the future of Europe. Some examples include:
   - **European Youth Event (EYE)**: This is a biennial event held in the European Parliament in Strasbourg. It's a great opportunity to meet other young people, learn about the EU, and have your voice heard. The next EYE is planned for May 2023.
   - **European Youth Dialogue**: This is an ongoing process that involves young people in policy-making. It includes regional and national events, as well as online discussions.

2. **LOCAL AND NATIONAL EVENTS**: Many EU Member States organise local and national events to celebrate Europe Day (May 9th) or Europe Week. These events often include workshops, games, and other activities that help young people understand the EU and its impact on their daily lives. Check with your local municipality or EU information point to see what's happening in your area.

3. **EUROPEAN VOLUNTARY SERVICE (EVS)**: If you're a bit older (17-30), you might be interested in the European Voluntary Service. This program allows young people to volunteer abroad for a period of 2 to 12 months, helping with various projects and learning new skills.

To participate in these events, you can:

- **Check the European Commission's Youth website**: They regularly update their events calendar
Q5_59_ I am 6 years old and from Denmark. I know kind of about European Citizens’ Initiative. Can you tell me more about this? What is it?

A European Citizens’ Initiative (ECI) is a way for citizens of the European Union (EU) to directly influence the EU’s decision-making process. It allows a large number of EU citizens to invite the European Commission, which is the executive branch of the EU, to propose a legal act in areas where the Commission has the power to do so.

Here are some key points about the ECI:

1. **Who can participate?** Any EU citizen, or a group of EU citizens, can start an ECI. To sign an ECI, you must be an EU citizen and be registered in a EU country's electoral roll.

2. **What can an ECI be about?** An ECI can be about any area where the European Commission has the power to propose legislation. This includes many areas like environment, energy, transport, consumer protection, and more. However, it cannot be about areas where the EU has no power, like taxation or defense.

3. **How does it work?** To start an ECI, you need to collect at least one million signatures from at least seven different EU countries within one year. If you succeed, the European Commission will have to examine your proposal and give a response, which could be a legislative proposal, a communication, or an explanation of why it cannot act.

4. **Why is it important?** The ECI gives EU citizens a direct say in the EU's decision-making process. It's a way for people to come together across borders and make their voices heard on issues they care about.

5. **Has it been used before?** Yes, there have been several ECIs since the process started in 2012. Some have led to changes in EU policy, while others haven't. You can find more information about past ECIs on the European Commission's website.

So, in simple terms, an ECI is like a big petition that EU citizens can use to try to influence EU laws.
