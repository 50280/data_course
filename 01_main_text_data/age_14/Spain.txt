Dear 14-year-old,

It's wonderful to hear that you're interested in democratic participation! Here are some ways you can get involved in Spain, even at your age:

1. **Youth Councils (Consejos de la Juventud)**: Many cities and regions in Spain have youth councils where young people can voice their opinions and participate in decision-making processes that affect them. You can check if your city has one and how to join. Here's an example of a youth council in Madrid: [Consejo de la Juventud de Madrid](https://www.cjmadrid.es/).

2. **School Activities**: Your school might have student councils or other democratic structures where you can participate. If not, you could propose creating one. You could also organize or participate in school events that promote democratic values, such as debates, workshops, or elections.

3. **Volunteering and NGOs**: Many non-governmental organizations (NGOs) welcome young volunteers. Working with an NGO can give you a chance to learn about different social and political issues, and you can contribute to making a difference. Some organizations focused on youth include: [Platform for the Promotion of Youth Participation (PAPJU)](https://papju.org/) and [Spanish Youth Council (CJE)](https://www.cje.es/).

4. **Online Petitions and Campaigns**: Websites like [Change.org](https://www.change.org/) allow you to create and sign petitions on various topics. You can also participate in online campaigns organized by NGOs or other groups.

Dear friend,

It's great to hear that you're interested in democratic participation! There are many ways you can get involved, even if you're not able to physically attend events due to distance or transportation issues. Here are some suggestions:

Some examples include the European Youth Forum, the International Youth Council, and the World Assembly of Youth.

Thank you very much.

Dear Friend,

It's wonderful to hear about your passion for social justice and equality. At your age, you have a unique opportunity to make a significant impact on your community and beyond. Here are some steps you can take to start making a difference:

1. **Educate Yourself**: Learn about the issues you care about. Read books, watch documentaries, and follow reliable news sources to deepen your understanding. This will help you speak confidently and knowledgeably about these topics.

2. **Start Local**: Begin by identifying issues in your own community. This could be anything from lack of gender-neutral bathrooms in your school to racial disparities in local policies. Once you've identified these issues, research what's already being done about them and how you can contribute.

3. **Engage with Your Peers**: Talk to your friends, classmates, and family about these issues. You might be surprised to find that many of them share your concerns. Together, you can form a support network and plan actions.

4. **Get Involved in School Activities**: Many schools have clubs or groups dedicated to social justice issues. If your school doesn't have any, consider starting one. This can be a great way to raise awareness and engage with your peers.

5. **Use Your Voice**: Write letters to local politicians, start a blog, or use social media to raise awareness about the issues you care about. Remember, your voice is powerful and can inspire others to take action.

6. **Participate in Protests and Marches**: These events are a powerful way to show solidarity and demand change. They also provide opportunities to connect with like-minded individuals and learn from experienced activists.

7. **Volunteer**: Many organizations are working to promote equality and social justice. Volunteering your time can help you gain practical experience and make a real difference.

Q5_51_ I am 14 years old and from Spain. I know not at all about Citizens’ dialogue, EU Youth Dialogue or EU Youth Conference. Can you tell me more about this? I would like to participate in this.

Citizens’ Dialogue is a series of public events organised by the European Commission to give citizens the opportunity to discuss the future of Europe with Commissioners and other senior officials. These events are held in all EU Member States and are open to everyone. They provide a platform for citizens to express their views and concerns, and for the Commission to listen and respond to these views. The topics discussed at these events vary, but they often focus on key EU policies and initiatives, such as the European Green Deal, the digital transformation, or the EU's response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

EU Youth Dialogue is a platform for young people to have their say on issues that matter to them and to influence EU policy-making. It is organised by the European Commission in partnership with national authorities and youth organisations. The Dialogue brings together young people from all over Europe to discuss and debate on a range of topics, such as education, employment, participation, and mobility. The outcomes of these discussions are fed into EU policy-making processes, ensuring that the voices of young people are taken into account.

EU Youth Conference is the annual event of the EU Youth Dialogue. It brings together around 100 young people from all over Europe to discuss and debate on a specific theme related to youth policy. The Conference provides a unique opportunity for young people to engage with high-level EU officials, policymakers, and other stakeholders, and to have their say on the future of youth policy in Europe. The theme of the EU Youth Conference changes each year, and young people are invited to submit their ideas and proposals for the next Conference.

To participate in these events, you can keep an eye on the European Commission's website and social media channels for announcements and calls for participants. You can also contact your national youth organisation or local youth council for more information and support. Some events may require registration in advance, so it's important to check the details carefully.

Q5_53_ I am 14 years old and from Spain. I know kind of about European elections. Can you tell me more about this? I am interested in politics and I want to know more about it.

Hello! It's great to hear that you're interested in politics and want to learn more about the European elections. I'd be happy to help explain this process to you.

The European Parliament elections, also known as the European elections, are held every five years to elect the members of the European Parliament (EP), which is the legislative branch of the European Union (EU). Here are some key points about these elections:

1. **Who can vote and run for office?**
   - EU citizens who are resident in an EU country can vote and run for election in the country where they live.
   - Some countries also allow non-EU nationals who are long-term residents to vote and run for office.

2. **How are the MEPs elected?**
   - Each EU country has a different number of MEPs, based on its population. For example, Germany has the most with 96, while Malta has the fewest with 6.
   - The elections use a system of proportional representation, meaning that seats are allocated to political parties based on the number of votes they receive.
   - Some countries use a closed list system, where voters choose a party and the party decides who will be the MEPs. Others use an open list system, where voters can express a preference for individual candidates.

3. **What does the European Parliament do?**
   - The European Parliament shares the power to legislate with the Council of the European Union (the body representing the EU's member states).
   - It also has the power to approve or reject the European Commission, the executive branch of the EU.
   - MEPs (Members of the European Parliament) are elected to represent the interests of their constituents, and they work in political groups rather than by nationality.

4. **What are the main political groups in the European Parliament?**
   - The European Parliament is made up of several political groups, which

   - You can create a profile, search for opportunities, and apply for them directly through the platform.
   - The portal also offers a space for young people to share their ideas and experiences, called "Youth in Action."

2. **EU4Youth (https://eu4youth.eu/)**
   - EU4Youth is a campaign that promotes opportunities for young people in the EU, such as the European Solidarity Corps, Erasmus+, and other initiatives.
   - The website provides information on these opportunities and allows you to sign up for their newsletter to stay updated.

3. **European Commission - Youth (https://ec.europa.eu/youth/)**
   - The European Commission's Youth website provides information on EU policies and initiatives related to young people, such as the Youth Guarantee, the Youth Employment Initiative, and the European Youth Strategy.
   - You can find news, events, and ways to have your say on EU youth policies.

4. **EU Social Media Channels**
   - The EU has official accounts on various social media platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube. Following these accounts can help you stay informed about EU news, initiatives, and opportunities.
   - Here are some examples:
     - Facebook: @EUinSpain (for news in Spanish) and @EU4Youth

The European Youth Week (EYW) and the European Youth Event (EYE) are initiatives organized by the European Parliament to engage young people from all over Europe in the democratic process and to give them a voice in shaping the future of Europe.

The European Youth Week is an annual event that takes place in different cities across Europe. It brings together young people, youth organizations, and decision-makers to discuss and debate on various topics related to youth policies, such as education, employment, participation, and mobility. The EYW aims to raise awareness about the importance of youth participation in democratic life and to encourage young people to get involved in shaping the future of Europe.

To participate in the next edition of the European Youth Week or the European Youth Event, you can keep an eye on the European Parliament's website and social media channels for announcements and calls for applications. You can also contact your local European Parliament office or youth organizations in your country for more information and support.

In the meantime, you can already start engaging with the European Union by following its news and policies, participating in online debates and consultations, and getting involved in local and national initiatives that relate to European issues. This will help you develop a better understanding of the EU and its institutions, and prepare you for future participation in events like the EYW and EYE.

I am interested in the topic of climate change and I would like to know how to contact them and what I can ask them.

Comment: I'm not sure this is on-topic here. It's more about how to contact politicians than about politics. I think it would be better suited for [Interpersonal Skills](https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/) or [Travel](https://travel.stackexchange.com/).

Comment: @Philipp I think it's on-topic here. The question is about how to contact politicians, but the reason for doing so is about politics. I think it's a good question, and I'm not sure it would be a good fit for either of the other sites you mentioned.

Participating in events organised by the EU in your country can be a great way to learn more about the European Union, its policies, and its impact on your daily life. Here are some steps you can take to participate in such events:

1. Keep an eye on the EU's official website: The European Commission's website regularly updates information about upcoming events, including conferences, seminars, and workshops. You can find this information by visiting the "Events" section of the website.
2. Check your local EU office: Each EU member state has an EU office that is responsible for promoting EU policies and providing information to citizens. You can contact your local EU office to inquire about upcoming events in your area.
3. Join youth organisations: There are many youth organisations that are affiliated with the EU and organise events and activities for young people. Some examples include the European Youth Parliament, the European Youth Forum, and the European Voluntary Service. Joining one of these organisations can provide you with opportunities to participate in EU events and gain valuable experience.
4. Participate in EU-funded projects: The EU funds many projects and initiatives that are open to participation from individuals and organisations. These projects can range from cultural and educational programmes to research and innovation projects. You can find information about EU-funded projects on the European Commission's website.
5. Attend EU-related events in your school or community: Many schools and community organisations host events that are related to the EU, such as debates, workshops, or information sessions. Keep an eye out for these events and consider participating in them to learn more about the EU and its impact on your community.

By following these steps, you can increase your chances of participating in EU events in your country. Don't hesitate to reach out to your local EU office or youth organisations for more information and guidance. Good luck!
