Q3_30_ I am 14 years old and from Romania. I have never taken part in activities that relate to democratic participation because I don’t understand the issues enough.

Thank you for your question. It's great that you're interested in democratic participation and want to learn more about it. Here are some ways you can get involved and some benefits of doing so:

1. **Educate Yourself**: The first step is to learn about the issues that affect you and your community. This could be anything from local school policies to global climate change. Here are some resources to help you:
   - News websites and apps (like BBC News, The Guardian, or local news platforms)
   - Educational videos on YouTube (like TED-Ed, Crash Course, or Kurzgesagt – In a Nutshell)
   - Books and documentaries on various topics

2. **Join Clubs or Groups**: Many schools have clubs or groups that focus on social issues, politics, or current events. Joining these can help you meet like-minded peers and learn more about these topics. If your school doesn't have any, you could start your own.

3. **Attend Local Events**: Check for local events like town halls, council meetings, or community gatherings. These can be great opportunities to learn about local issues and voice your opinions.

4. **Volunteer**: Volunteering for local charities or community organizations can give you a hands-on understanding of how decisions affect people's lives.

5. **Engage Online**: Platforms like Change.org allow you to sign petitions and start campaigns on issues you care about. Social media can also be a place to discuss and learn about current events.

6. **Talk to Others**: Discussing issues with friends, family, and teachers can help you form your own opinions and understand different perspectives.

It's great to hear that you're interested in democratic participation! There are many ways you can get involved, even if you're not able to physically attend events due to distance or other barriers. Here are some suggestions:

3. **Write Letters or Emails**: Reach out to your local representatives, politicians, or organizations to express your views. You can write letters or send emails about issues that matter to you.

4. **Join Online Communities**: There are many online communities and groups dedicated to various causes and issues. Joining these can help you connect with like-minded individuals and participate in discussions and actions.

Q5_51_ I am 14 years old and from Romania. I know not at all about Citizens’ dialogue, EU Youth Dialogue or EU Youth Conference. Can you tell me more about this? I am very interested in this topic.

Dear friend,

I'm glad to hear about your interest in the EU Youth Dialogue and Citizens' Dialogue! These initiatives are great opportunities for young people like you to have a say in shaping the future of Europe. Let me explain them in a bit more detail:

1. **EU Youth Dialogue**: This is a platform for young people to express their views and ideas on topics that matter to them, such as education, employment, participation, and understanding of Europe. The dialogue is structured in three phases:

   - **Consultation**: The European Commission asks young people for their opinions on a specific topic through an online survey.
   - **Multiplier events**: National authorities and youth organizations organize events to discuss the survey results and gather more input from young people.
   - **EU Youth Conference**: The most active and engaged young people are invited to an EU-level conference to present their ideas and recommendations to policymakers.

   The EU Youth Dialogue is a great way to make your voice heard and influence EU policies. You can find more information and participate in the online consultations on the European Commission's website: https://ec.europa.eu/youth/youthdialogue_en

2. **Citizens' Dialogue**: This is a series of public events organized by the European Commission and other EU institutions to engage with EU citizens and discuss EU policies and priorities. These dialogues provide a platform for open and informal conversations between EU representatives and citizens, including young people.

   Citizens' Dialogues cover a wide range of topics, from the EU's long-term budget to climate change, digital transformation, and more. They can take place in various formats, such as town hall meetings, online discussions, or even through social media.

   To find out about upcoming Citizens' Dialogues and how to participate, you can check the European Commission's events page: https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initi

Q5_59_ I am 14 years old and from Romania. I know not at all about European Citizens’ Initiative. Can you tell me more about this? What is it? How can I participate? What are the benefits of this initiative?

The European Citizens’ Initiative (ECI) is a unique tool for citizens to participate directly in the democratic life of the European Union (EU). It was introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon in 2009 and allows EU citizens to propose new legislation in areas where the EU has competence. Here’s a simple breakdown:

1. **What is the European Citizens’ Initiative (ECI)?**
   - It’s a way for citizens to propose new EU legislation directly, without the need for a Member State or the European Parliament to take the initiative.
   - It’s a tool for participatory democracy, allowing EU citizens to have a direct say in the EU’s decision-making process.

2. **How does it work?**
   - To launch an ECI, you need to be a citizen of the EU and gather support from at least one million EU citizens from at least seven different Member States.
   - The proposal must fall within the EU’s competences (areas where the EU has the power to legislate).
   - Once the initiative is registered, you have one year to collect signatures. If you succeed, the European Commission will examine the initiative and decide whether to propose legislation based on it.

3. **How can you participate?**
   - You can participate in an ongoing ECI by signing it if you’re an EU citizen and you agree with the proposal.
   - You can also start your own ECI if you have an idea for new EU legislation. You’ll need to gather a committee of at least seven citizens from at least seven different Member States to support you.
   - You can also support an ECI by helping to collect signatures or by promoting it.

4. **Benefits of the ECI:**
   - **Direct participation:** The ECI gives EU citizens a direct say in the EU’s decision-making process.
   - **Transparency:** ECIs are
