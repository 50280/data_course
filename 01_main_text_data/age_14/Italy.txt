I understand that you are looking for ways to make your voice heard beyond traditional political channels. Here are some alternative methods you might consider:

1. **Social Media Activism**: Platforms like Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook allow you to connect with a wide audience and raise awareness about issues you care about. You can use these platforms to share information, start conversations, and even organize protests or petitions.

2. **Blogging or Vlogging**: Starting your own blog or vlog can help you reach a larger audience and express your views in depth. You can write about or discuss topics that are important to you and provide solutions or perspectives that others might not have considered.

3. **Community Organizing**: You can start or join local community groups focused on issues you care about. These groups can organize events, protests, or letter-writing campaigns to make their voices heard.

4. **Petitions**: Websites like Change.org allow you to start or sign petitions on a wide range of issues. These petitions can be sent directly to decision-makers and can help to raise awareness about important causes.

5. **Artivism**: This is a portmanteau of "art" and "activism". It involves using art forms like music, poetry, painting, or street art to raise awareness about social and political issues. This can be a powerful way to engage people emotionally with your message.

6. **Education and Awareness**: You can organize workshops, seminars, or talks to educate people about issues you care about. This can help to build a more informed and engaged community.

4. **Engage on Social Media:**
   - Use platforms like Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook to raise awareness about climate change. Share facts, stories, and your own experiences.

Q1_6_ I am 14 years old and from Italy. I think that to make my voice heard Boycotting or buying certain products for political, ethical or environmental reasons is not at all effective. Can you give me more ways of doing this? I want to do something to help the world.

I'm glad to hear that you're interested in making a difference! While boycotts and conscious consumerism are indeed important, there are many other ways you can contribute to positive change. Here are some suggestions:

1. **Education and Awareness**: Learn about the issues you care about and share your knowledge with others. This can help inspire more people to take action. You can start a blog, create videos, or simply have conversations with friends and family.

2. **Volunteer**: Many organizations need help with various tasks. You can volunteer your time to support causes you believe in. This could be anything from helping at an animal shelter to participating in beach clean-ups.

3. **Advocacy**: Write letters to politicians, sign petitions, or participate in protests to raise your voice about issues you care about. You can also use social media to amplify your voice.

4. **Community Service**: Look for local projects or initiatives that align with your values. This could be anything from helping with a community garden to tutoring younger students.

5. **Fundraising**: If you have a skill or talent, you can use it to raise money for causes you believe in. This could be anything from selling handmade crafts to organizing a charity concert.

6. **Reduce, Reuse, Recycle**: While you mentioned that you think boycotts aren't effective, reducing your own consumption and waste can have a significant impact. This includes things like reducing meat consumption, using reusable bags and bottles, and recycling.

7. **Support Local Businesses**: While boycotting large corporations might not have a big impact, supporting local businesses can help promote a more sustainable and equitable economy.

Q3_30_ I am 14 years old and from Italy. I have never taken part in activities that relate to democratic participation because I don’t understand the issues enough. For my friends, this is not at all the same. Can you tell me more about how I can do that? I would like to know more about the issues that are important to me and how I can participate in the democratic process.

Dear friend,

It's wonderful to hear that you're interested in getting involved in democratic participation and understanding the issues that matter to you. Here are some steps you can take to get started:

1. **Educate Yourself**: The first step is to learn about the issues that are important to you. Here are some resources that might help:
   - **News Websites**: Websites like BBC News, The Guardian, or local Italian news sites can help you stay updated on current events.
   - **Documentaries and Videos**: Platforms like YouTube, TED Talks, and Netflix have many documentaries and videos that discuss various social, political, and environmental issues.
   - **Books**: Reading books on topics you're interested in can provide a deeper understanding. Some recommendations could be "Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind" by Yuval Noah Harari, "The Spirit Level" by Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett, or "This Changes Everything" by Naomi Klein.

2. **Join Clubs or Groups**: Look for clubs or groups at your school or in your community that focus on issues you care about. This could be anything from environmental conservation to social justice. If there aren't any, consider starting your own.

3. **Attend Local Events**: Participate in local events like town halls, council meetings, or protests. These can be great opportunities to learn more about the issues and voice your opinions.

4. **Engage on Social Media**: Follow organizations, influencers, and politicians who align with your values. Engage with their posts by liking, sharing, and commenting. This can help you stay informed and connect with like-minded individuals.

5. **Write Letters or Petitions**: Writing letters to local representatives or signing petitions can be a powerful way to make your voice heard. Websites like Change.org make it
Q3_31_ I am 14 years old and from Italy. I have never taken part in activities that relate to democratic participation because Nobody has ever asked or invited me to take part. For my friends, this is not at all the same. Can you tell me more about how I can do that? I would like to know more about how to participate in democratic activities in my city.

Thank you for your question. It's great to see young people like you interested in participating in democratic activities. Here are some steps you can take to get involved:

1. **Find Out About Local Government**: Start by understanding how your local government works. In Italy, local governments are divided into regions, provinces, and communes. Each has its own elected officials and responsibilities. You can visit your commune's website or city hall to learn more.

2. **Join Youth Organizations**: There might be youth organizations or councils in your city that focus on involving young people in local decision-making processes. These groups often provide opportunities for young people to voice their opinions and ideas. Some examples include:
   - "Consulta Giovanile" (Youth Council) in many Italian cities.
   - "Associazione Nazionale Comuni Italiani" (ANCI) which has a youth section called "ANCI Giovani".

3. **Participate in Public Meetings**: Many cities hold public meetings or town halls where citizens can discuss local issues with elected officials. These are great opportunities to learn about what's happening in your city and to have your voice heard.

4. **Volunteer**: Volunteering for local non-profit organizations or community events can also be a way to participate in democratic activities. It allows you to contribute to your community and meet other people who are interested in making a difference.

5. **Engage Online**: Many cities have online platforms where you can participate in discussions, vote on local issues, or report problems in your neighborhood. Some examples include:
   - "Decide Madrid" in Madrid, Spain (though not in Italian, it's a good example of an online participatory platform).
   - "Partecipa Milano" in Milan, Italy.

6. **Educate Yourself**: Learn about the issues that matter to you and the policies that affect your community. This will

Dear friend,

It's wonderful to hear that you're interested in participating in the democratic process in Italy! Here are some ways you can get involved, even at your age:

   - "Giovani Democratici" (Democratic Youth): https://www.giovanidemocratici.it/

2. **Participate in School Activities**: Your school might have student councils or other forms of student representation. Joining these can help you learn about decision-making processes and express your opinions on school-related matters.

3. **Attend Local Events**: Keep an eye out for local events, such as town hall meetings, community gatherings, or political rallies. These can be great opportunities to learn about local issues and connect with people who share your interests.

4. **Volunteer**: Volunteering for local charities, environmental groups, or other causes can help you understand the needs of your community and make a difference. It can also give you a sense of how different groups work together to achieve common goals.

5. **Educate Yourself**: Learn about the Italian political system, the roles of different institutions (like the Parliament, Senate, and regional governments), and the main political parties. This knowledge will help you understand how to participate effectively.

Q4b_44_ I am 14 years old and from Italy. I am a little interested in changing society in the area of Equal rights regardless of gender, race or sexuality. Can you tell me how I can do this? I know it's a big question but I would really appreciate any advice you could give me.

Thank you for your time.

Dear Friend,

It's wonderful to hear that you're already thinking about how to make the world a better place, especially at such a young age. Here are some steps you can take to start making a difference in the area of equal rights:

1. **Educate Yourself**: Learn about the issues you care about. Read books, watch documentaries, and follow reliable news sources to understand the root causes of inequality and the challenges faced by different communities. This will help you speak confidently and knowledgeably about these issues.

2. **Start Local**: Begin by making a difference in your own community. This could be at school, in your neighborhood, or within your family. Here are a few ideas:
   - **School**: Start or join a club focused on social justice. You could organize events to raise awareness about different issues, or start a mentoring program for younger students.
   - **Neighborhood**: Organize community clean-ups, start a community garden, or help with local charity events.
   - **Family**: Have open conversations about equality and respect. Lead by example and treat everyone with kindness and respect.

3. **Use Your Voice**: Speak up when you see or hear something that's not right. This could be as simple as correcting a friend who makes a derogatory joke, or as big as organizing a protest. Remember, your voice matters, and you have the power to influence those around you.

4. **Advocate Online**: Use social media to raise awareness about issues you care about. Share reliable information, start conversations, and use your platforms to amplify the voices of others.

5. **Get Involved in Politics**: Understand the political process and how it affects the issues you care about. This could mean attending local council meetings, writing to your representatives, or even running for student council at your school.

Q5_51_ I am 14 years old and from Italy. I know not at all about Citizens’ dialogue, EU Youth Dialogue or EU Youth Conference. Can you tell me more about this? I would like to participate in these events.

Citizens’ Dialogue, EU Youth Dialogue, and EU Youth Conference are all initiatives organized by the European Union (EU) to engage citizens, especially young people, in discussions and decision-making processes related to EU policies. Here’s a brief overview of each:

1. **Citizens’ Dialogue**: This is a series of public events organized by the European Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen, and other EU institution presidents. The aim is to give citizens the opportunity to discuss EU policies and priorities directly with EU leaders. These events are open to everyone, but they are often organized in specific locations, so you might need to check if there are any planned near you. You can find more information on the European Commission’s website: https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/12660-Citizens-Dialogues-with-EU-leaders_en

2. **EU Youth Dialogue**: This is a structured dialogue between young people and EU institutions. It aims to give young people a say in matters that concern them, such as education, employment, and participation in democratic life. The EU Youth Dialogue is organized in several phases, including national and European levels. At the national level, young people discuss and vote on topics they want to bring to the attention of EU institutions. The results are then presented at the European level. To participate, you can get involved in your national structures, such as youth councils or organizations working on youth issues. More information can be found here: https://europa.eu/youth/eu-youth-dialogue_en

3. **EU Youth Conference**: This is the annual event where young people from all EU Member States come together to discuss and vote on a topic related to youth policies. The conference is organized by the European Commission, in cooperation with the Member States. The results of the conference are then presented to the Council of

Q5_53_ I am 14 years old and from Italy. I know kind of about European elections. Can you tell me more about this? I am interested in politics and I want to know more about the European Union.

The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of 27 member states that are primarily located in Europe. It has developed an internal single market through a standardized system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital, and to enhance political, economic, and social cooperation.

The European Parliament is the legislative branch of the EU, and it is directly elected by EU citizens every five years. The next European Parliament elections are scheduled to take place in May 2024. Here are some key points about the European elections:

1. **Who can vote?** EU citizens who are resident in a member state other than their own can vote in the European elections in their country of residence. For example, if you are an Italian citizen living in Germany, you can vote in the German European elections. Alternatively, you can vote in your home country if you are temporarily abroad (e.g., studying or working) and maintain your registration there.
2. **Who can run?** European political parties and national political parties can put forward candidates for the European elections. These candidates are part of transnational lists, which allow voters to choose a political party rather than individual candidates. The number of seats allocated to each member state is determined by its population size.
3. **How are seats allocated?** The seats in the European Parliament are allocated using a system of proportional representation. This means that the number of seats a political party wins is proportional to the number of votes it receives. The allocation of seats is done using different electoral systems in each member state, but the overall result is a parliament that reflects the political preferences of EU citizens.
4. **What does the European Parliament do?** The European Parliament has several key roles in the EU's decision-making process. It shares legislative power with the Council of the EU (representing the member states

Q5_56_ I am 14 years old and from Italy. I know not at all about The European Youth Week or the European Youth Event. Can you tell me more about this? Thank you.

The European Youth Week and the European Youth Event are initiatives organized by the European Union (EU) to engage young people in the democratic life of the EU and to give them a voice in shaping Europe's future.

1. **European Youth Week (EYW)**: This is an annual event that takes place in early May. It aims to celebrate and promote youth engagement, participation, and active citizenship across Europe. During the EYW, various activities and events are organized by local, regional, and national authorities, as well as by youth organizations and other stakeholders.

It brings together thousands of young people from all over Europe to discuss and debate on various topics related to the EU's policies and priorities. The event provides a unique opportunity for young people to engage directly with EU decision-makers, including Members of the European Parliament (MEPs), and to share their ideas and concerns about the future of Europe. The EYE also includes workshops, debates, cultural activities, and opportunities for young people to learn more about the EU's institutions and how they work.

Both the European Youth Week and the European Youth Event are important platforms for young people to express their views, exchange ideas, and learn about the EU. They also help to foster a sense of European identity and citizenship among young people and to promote their active participation in democratic life.

Q5_59_ I am 14 years old and from Italy. I know not at all about European Citizens’ Initiative. Can you tell me more about this? What is it? How does it work? What are the benefits? What are the drawbacks? What are the chances of success? What are the main issues that have been addressed by the ECI? What are the main issues that could be addressed by the ECI in the future?

The European Citizens’ Initiative (ECI) is a unique tool of participatory democracy in the European Union (EU). It allows citizens to participate directly in the development of EU policies. Here’s a breakdown of your questions:

1. **What is the European Citizens’ Initiative (ECI)?**
   The ECI is a right for EU citizens to invite the European Commission, one of the EU's executive bodies, to propose a legal act in areas where the Commission has the power to do so. It was introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon in 2009.

2. **How does it work?**
   - **Initiation**: At least one million EU citizens from at least seven different Member States must support the initiative within one year. The initiative must be registered with the European Commission.
   - **Assessment**: The Commission assesses whether the initiative is admissible, i.e., whether it falls within the Commission's competence and respects the Treaty provisions.
   - **Response**: If the initiative is successful, the Commission decides, within three months, whether to take action or not. If it decides not to, it must explain why.

3. **Benefits**:
   - It gives EU citizens a direct say in EU policy-making.
   - It can raise awareness about important issues and spark public debate.
   - It can influence the Commission's agenda and priorities.

4. **Drawbacks**:
   - The threshold of one million signatures is high, making it difficult for initiatives to succeed.
   - The Commission is not obliged to act on the initiative, even if it reaches the threshold.
   - The process can be complex and time-consuming.
