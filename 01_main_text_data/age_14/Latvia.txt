Q3_30_ I am 14 years old and from Latvia. I have never taken part in activities that relate to democratic participation because I don’t understand the issues enough. For my friends, this is not at all the same. Can you tell me more about how I can do that? What are the benefits of participating in democratic activities?

Democratic participation is a crucial aspect of a healthy society, and it's great that you're interested in learning more about it. Here are some ways you can get involved, along with their benefits:

1. **Educate Yourself**: The first step is to learn about the issues that matter to you. This could be anything from local community issues to global problems like climate change or social inequality. Read books, watch documentaries, and follow reliable news sources to stay informed.

2. **Join Clubs or Groups**: Many schools and communities have clubs or groups focused on social issues, politics, or advocacy. Joining one of these can help you connect with like-minded individuals and learn more about how to make a difference.

3. **Volunteer**: Volunteering for local organizations or causes you care about can give you hands-on experience in making a difference. It also helps you understand the issues from a practical perspective.

4. **Attend Local Meetings**: Many local governments have meetings that are open to the public. Attending these can give you a firsthand look at how decisions are made and how you can influence them.

5. **Write to Your Representatives**: Whether it's your local city council member or a member of parliament, writing to them about issues you care about can help influence their decisions. They represent you, so they should hear from you.

6. **Participate in Protests or Demonstrations**: When organized peacefully, these can be a powerful way to raise awareness about issues. They show decision-makers that there's a significant group of people who care about a particular issue.

7. **Vote**: When you're old enough, voting is one of the most important ways to participate in democracy. It's your chance to have a say in who represents you and the policies they implement.

Benefits of participating in democratic activities:

I have never taken part in activities that relate to democratic participation because I did not know that I could do this. For my friends, this is a lot the same.

Here are some ways you can participate in democratic processes, both locally and globally:

These organizations offer opportunities to learn about democracy, develop leadership skills, and participate in decision-making processes.

Dear friend,

It's great to hear that you're interested in democratic participation! There are many ways you can get involved, even if you're not able to physically attend events due to distance or transportation issues. Here are some suggestions:

1. **Online Platforms**: Many organizations and governments now offer online platforms for civic engagement. You can participate in online forums, surveys, or petitions to voice your opinions and have a say in decision-making processes. Some examples include:
   - European Youth Portal: <https://europa.eu/youth/portal_en>
   - European Commission's Have Your Say: <https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say_en>
   - Change.org (for petitions): <https://www.change.org/>

2. **Social Media**: Follow local, national, and European political figures, organizations, and institutions on social media. Engage with their posts by liking, sharing, and commenting. This can help raise awareness about issues you care about and start conversations.

3. **Youth Organizations**: Join local or international youth organizations that focus on democratic participation, human rights, or other causes you're passionate about. Some examples include:
   - European Youth Forum: <https://www.youthforum.org/>
   - Youth of the European People's Party (YEPP): <https://www.yepp.org/>
   - Young European Socialists (YES): <https://www.youngsocialists.eu/>

4. **School Activities**: Get involved in school activities that promote democratic values and participation. This could be student councils, debating clubs, or social action projects.

5. **Local Community**: Look for opportunities to participate in local community activities, such as town hall meetings, community clean-ups, or local charity events. Even if you can't attend in person, you might be able to help organize or promote these events online.


Q4b_41_ I am 14 years old and from Latvia. I am a little interested in changing society in the area of Climate change and environmental protection. Can you tell me how I can do this? I have no idea where to start.

I am glad to hear about your interest in making a difference in the area of climate change and environmental protection! Here are some steps you can take to get started:

1. **Educate Yourself**: Learn as much as you can about climate change, its causes, effects, and solutions. This will help you understand the issues better and communicate them effectively to others. Websites like NASA's Global Climate Change, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and National Geographic can be helpful resources.

2. **Start at Home**: Begin by making changes in your own life. This could be anything from reducing your water and energy usage, to recycling, to eating less meat. Every small action helps and can inspire others.

3. **Engage Your School**: See if your school has an environmental club or if you can start one. You could organize events like tree planting, beach clean-ups, or awareness campaigns. You could also push for more eco-friendly practices in your school, like reducing waste or using energy-efficient light bulbs.

4. **Join Local Environmental Groups**: Look for local environmental organizations in your area. They often have youth programs or you could volunteer with them. This can give you practical experience and help you connect with like-minded people.

5. **Participate in Global Initiatives**: There are many global initiatives that you can join. For example, the Fridays For Future movement, inspired by Greta Thunberg, encourages students to strike from school on Fridays to demand climate action. You could also participate in events like Earth Hour or World Environment Day.

6. **Use Social Media**: Platforms like Instagram, Twitter, and TikTok can be powerful tools for raising awareness. Share facts about climate change, post about the actions you're taking, and use relevant hashtags to reach a wider audience.

7. **Write Letters or Petitions**: Write letters to your local representatives, or start petitions

Q5_59_ I am 14 years old and from Latvia. I know not at all about European Citizens’ Initiative. Can you tell me more about this? What is it? How can I participate? What are the benefits of it?

The European Citizens’ Initiative (ECI) is a unique tool for EU citizens to participate directly in the EU policy-making process. It was introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon in 2009 and has been in operation since 2012. Here’s a simple breakdown to help you understand it:

1. **What is the European Citizens’ Initiative?**
   The ECI is a way for citizens of the European Union to call on the European Commission to propose new legislation on issues that concern them. It’s a way for EU citizens to have a direct say in EU policies.

2. **How does it work?**
   - **Collecting signatures**: To launch an ECI, you need to form a citizens’ committee of at least 7 EU citizens from at least 7 different EU Member States. The committee then has one year to collect at least one million signatures from EU citizens in at least 7 different Member States. These signatures must be collected using the official ECI platform.
   - **Review by the Commission**: Once the signatures are collected, the European Commission reviews the initiative. If it’s relevant for EU action and falls within the Commission’s competences, the Commission will decide whether to propose legislation or not. If the Commission decides not to act, it must explain its reasons to the European Parliament and the Council.

3. **How can you participate?**
   - **Support an ongoing ECI**: You can support an ongoing ECI by signing it on the official ECI platform. To do this, you’ll need to provide some personal information, such as your name, address, and date of birth.
   - **Start your own ECI**: If you’re at least 18 years old and an EU citizen, you can also start your own ECI. You’ll need to form a citizens’ committee and follow the steps outlined above.
