There are many ways to participate in democratic activities, and some of them include:

2. Joining a political party: Political parties are a key part of the democratic process, and joining one can give you a chance to influence the policies and priorities of the party. You can also help to campaign for candidates and promote the party's message.
3. Participating in protests and demonstrations: Protests and demonstrations are a way to make your voice heard on issues that you care about. They can help to raise awareness of important issues and put pressure on decision-makers to take action.
4. Joining a community group or organization: Community groups and organizations often work on issues that affect local communities, such as environmental protection, housing, or education. Joining one can give you a chance to work with others to make a difference in your community.

Q3_30_ I am 14 years old and from Greece. I have never taken part in activities that relate to democratic participation because I don’t understand the issues enough. For my friends, this is kind of the same. Can you tell me more about how I can do that? How can I participate in democratic activities? What are the benefits of participating in democratic activities?

Democratic participation is a crucial aspect of a healthy and functioning democracy. It allows citizens to have a say in the decisions that affect their lives and communities, and it helps to ensure that those in power are held accountable for their actions. Here are some ways you can participate in democratic activities, along with their benefits:

1. **Voting**: Once you reach the legal voting age, make sure to register and vote in local, national, and European elections. Your vote matters, and it's an essential way to express your preferences and influence the direction of your country.

2. **Join a political party or youth organization**: Many political parties have youth wings or offer membership to young people. Joining one can help you understand different political ideologies, engage in debates, and learn about the political process. Some youth organizations focused on democracy and participation include:
   - Young Democrats for Europe (YDE)
   - European Youth Parliament (EYP)
   - Youth of the European People's Party (YEPP)
   - Young European Socialists (YES)

3. **Attend public meetings and events**: Participate in town halls, council meetings, and other public events where local issues are discussed. This is an opportunity to learn about the concerns of your community and voice your own opinions.

4. **Engage in online debates and discussions**: Follow political news and engage in online discussions on social media platforms, forums, and blogs. This can help you develop critical thinking skills and learn from others' perspectives.

5. **Volunteer and participate in community initiatives**: Get involved in local projects, charities, or NGOs that focus on issues you care about. This can help you gain a better understanding of the challenges facing your community and give you a chance to make a difference.

Q5_58_ I am 14 years old and from Greece. I know a little about Participation in events organised by the EU in your country. Can you tell me more about this? I would like to participate in such events.

Participation in events organised by the EU in your country can be a great way to learn more about the European Union, its policies, and its impact on your daily life. Here are some ways you can participate:

1. **EU Information Days and Events**: The EU Delegation in your country often organises information days, seminars, and workshops on various topics such as EU funding opportunities, youth programmes, research and innovation, and more. These events are usually open to the public and can be a great way to learn and engage with EU officials and experts. You can find these events on the EU Delegation's website or social media pages.

2. **EU-funded Projects**: Many EU-funded projects organise events and activities open to the public. These projects cover a wide range of topics, from culture and education to research and innovation. You can find these projects and their events on the EU's funding and tenders portal (https://ec.europa.eu/info/financing-eu-funds_en) or by searching for EU-funded projects in your country.

3. **EU Youth Dialogue**: The EU Youth Dialogue is a platform for young people to have their say on matters that affect them. It's an opportunity to share your ideas and contribute to EU policy-making. The EU Delegation in your country might organise local events or consultations as part of this dialogue. You can find more information on the EU Youth Dialogue website (https://europa.eu/youth/eu-youth-dialogue_en).

4. **EU-funded Youth Exchanges and Training Courses**: The EU offers various youth exchange and training programmes, such as Erasmus+, which can provide you with the opportunity to travel, meet other young people from across Europe, and develop new skills.

Q5_59_ I am 14 years old and from Greece. I know not at all about European Citizens’ Initiative. Can you tell me more about this? What is it? How can I participate? What are the benefits of participating?

The European Citizens’ Initiative (ECI) is a unique tool for citizens to participate directly in the democratic life of the European Union (EU). It allows you to call on the European Commission to propose new legislation in areas where the Commission has the power to do so. Here’s a simple breakdown:

1. **What is the European Citizens’ Initiative (ECI)?**
   - It’s a way for citizens of the EU to directly influence EU policy-making.
   - It was introduced in 2012 as part of the Treaty of Lisbon to increase citizen participation in the EU.
   - It allows you to propose new EU legislation if you can gather one million statements of support from EU citizens within one year.

2. **How can you participate?**
   - **Start an ECI**: You can start an ECI if you are a citizen of an EU country and you are part of a citizens’ committee of at least seven people from at least seven different EU countries. You need to register your ECI with the European Commission.
   - **Support an ECI**: You can also participate by supporting an ECI that has already been started. To do this, you need to sign the initiative online or on paper. You can find a list of ongoing ECIs on the European Commission’s website.

3. **Benefits of participating**:
   - **Direct Influence**: Participating in an ECI gives you a direct say in EU policy-making. It’s a way to make your voice heard on issues that matter to you.
   - **Democracy in Action**: It’s a chance to see democracy in action and understand how the EU works.
   - **Learning Opportunity**: It can be a great learning experience, helping you understand EU policies, how they’re made, and how they affect your life.
   - **Networking**: If you start or support an ECI, you
