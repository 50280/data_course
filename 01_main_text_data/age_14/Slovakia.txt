Q5_53_ I am 14 years old and from Slovakia. I know kind of about European elections. Can you tell me more about this? I am interested in politics and I want to know more about it.

Thank you for your question! I'm glad to hear that you're interested in politics and European elections. Here's a breakdown to help you understand the process better:

1. **What are the European Elections?**
   The European Elections, also known as the Elections to the European Parliament, are elections held every five years to elect the members of the European Parliament (EP). The EP is the legislative branch of the European Union (EU), along with the Council of the European Union.

2. **When do they happen?**
   The elections are held in late May or early June. The next ones are scheduled for May 23-26, 2024.

3. **Who can vote?**
   Citizens of EU member states who are at least 18 years old (the voting age varies by country) can vote in the European Elections. However, since you're from Slovakia, you're eligible to vote once you reach the voting age in your country.

4. **How are the MEPs elected?**
   Each EU member state has a certain number of seats in the European Parliament, allocated based on its population. The exact method of election varies by country, but it's often a form of proportional representation. Some countries use a closed list system, while others allow voters to express preferences within the lists.

5. **What does the European Parliament do?**
   The EP has several key roles:
   - **Legislative Power**: It shares the power to make laws with the Council of the EU. Most EU laws are adopted jointly by the EP and the Council.
   - **Budget**: The EP has the power to approve or reject the EU's budget.
   - **Supervision**: It supervises the work of the European Commission, which is the executive branch of the EU.
   - **International Agreements**: The EP must give its consent before international agreements can
Q5_54_ I am 14 years old and from Slovakia. I know not at all about EU social media channels and websites (i.e. European Youth Portal). Can you tell me more about this? Thank you.

2. **EU40 (https://www.eu40.org/)**
   - EU40 is a network of young professionals working in the EU institutions and related organizations. They aim to connect young people with the EU and provide a platform for them to engage in policy debates.

Q5_55_ I am 14 years old and from Slovakia. I know not at all about Visit of the EU institutions. Can you tell me more about this? Thank you.

The Visit of the EU institutions is a program organized by the European Parliament for young people aged 16 to 18 from all EU Member States. The program aims to give young people a better understanding of how the EU works and how they can participate in the democratic process.

During the visit, participants have the opportunity to:

* Visit the European Parliament in Strasbourg or Brussels
* Meet with Members of the European Parliament (MEPs)
* Attend a plenary session of the European Parliament
* Visit other EU institutions, such as the European Commission or the Council of the EU
* Participate in workshops and debates on EU topics
* Learn about the history and functioning of the EU

The Visit of the EU institutions is a great opportunity for young people to learn more about the EU and to engage with EU decision-makers. It is also a chance to meet other young people from different EU Member States and to exchange ideas and experiences.

To participate in the program, young people need to apply through their national parliament or through a school. The selection process is usually competitive, and participants are chosen based on their interest in EU affairs and their motivation to learn more about the EU.

In Slovakia, the National Council of the Slovak Republic is responsible for organizing the selection process for the Visit of the EU institutions. More information about the program and the application process can be found on the website of the European Parliament or on the website of the National Council of the Slovak Republic.

I hope this information is helpful! Let me know if you have any other questions.

Comment: Welcome to the site. I'm not sure what you mean by "Participation in events organised by the EU in your country". Do you mean events that are held in Slovakia, or events that are held in other countries but that you can participate in from Slovakia? Or something else?

Comment: I mean events that are held in Slovakia.

Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "events organised by the EU". Do you mean events that are held in Slovakia and that are organised by the EU? Or do you mean events that are held in Slovakia and that are organised by other people but that are somehow related to the EU? Or something else?

Q5_59_ I am 14 years old and from Slovakia. I know not at all about European Citizens’ Initiative. Can you tell me more about this? What is it? How can I participate? What are the benefits of this initiative?

The European Citizens’ Initiative (ECI) is a unique tool for EU citizens to participate directly in the EU’s democratic life. It allows you to call on the European Commission to propose new legislation in areas where the Commission has the power to do so. Here’s a simple breakdown:

1. **What is the European Citizens’ Initiative (ECI)?**
   - It’s a way for EU citizens to influence EU policy-making.
   - It was introduced in 2012 as part of the Treaty of Lisbon to bring EU citizens closer to the EU institutions.
   - It allows EU citizens to propose new legislation in areas where the European Commission has the power to propose laws.

2. **How does it work?**
   - At least one million EU citizens from at least seven different EU Member States must support the initiative within one year.
   - If an ECI gathers one million statements of support, the Commission will examine whether the initiative meets the conditions for being submitted to the European Parliament, the Council, and the Commission.
   - If the initiative meets these conditions, the Commission will decide whether to take action, either by proposing legislation or explaining why it will not.

3. **How can you participate?**
   - You need to be an EU citizen and at least 18 years old.
   - You can support an ongoing ECI by signing the initiative online or on paper. You can find a list of ongoing ECIs on the European Commission’s website.
   - If you want to start your own ECI, you need to form a citizens’ committee of at least seven citizens from at least seven different Member States. You’ll need to register your committee and submit your proposal to the Commission.

4. **Benefits of the ECI:**
   - It gives EU citizens a direct say in EU policy-making.
   - It can help raise awareness about important issues
