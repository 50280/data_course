Dear friend,

It's great to hear that you're interested in democratic participation! There are many ways you can get involved, even if you're not able to physically attend events due to distance or transportation issues. Here are some suggestions:

Q5_51_ I am 14 years old and from Cyprus. I know not at all about Citizens’ dialogue, EU Youth Dialogue or EU Youth Conference. Can you tell me more about this? I am interested in the topic of Youth Unemployment.

Dear 14-year-old,

It's great to hear that you're interested in learning about the EU Youth Dialogue, Citizens' Dialogue, and the EU Youth Conference, especially in relation to the important topic of youth unemployment. I'll do my best to explain these concepts in a simple and clear way.

1. **EU Youth Dialogue**: This is a platform created by the European Commission to give young people a voice and to influence EU policy-making. It's a way for young people to share their ideas, concerns, and experiences with policymakers. The EU Youth Dialogue focuses on several themes, including education, employment, participation, and more. Here's how it works:

   - **EU Youth Conferences**: These are events where young people from all over Europe come together to discuss a specific theme. They share their ideas, vote on priorities, and create recommendations for policymakers. The next EU Youth Conference will be held in 2022, and it will focus on the European Youth Goal "Engaged".

   - **National Working Groups**: In each EU member state, there are national working groups where young people can discuss the EU Youth Dialogue themes and prepare for the EU Youth Conferences.

   - **Online Consultations**: The EU Youth Dialogue also includes online consultations where young people can share their opinions and ideas.

2. **Citizens' Dialogue**: This is a series of events organized by the European Commission to give citizens the opportunity to discuss EU policies and priorities with Commissioners and other high-level EU representatives. These events are open to everyone, and they often focus on specific topics, like the EU's response to the COVID-19 pandemic or the European Green Deal. The Citizens' Dialogue is a way for the EU to listen to and engage with its citizens.

3. **EU Youth Conference**: As mentioned earlier, the EU Youth Conference is a key part
Q5_52_ I am 14 years old and from Cyprus. I know not at all about Public consultations. Can you tell me more about this? What is it? How can I participate? What are the benefits of participating? What are the risks? How can I make my voice heard?

Public consultations are a way for governments, organizations, and other bodies to gather input and feedback from the public on various issues, policies, or projects. They provide an opportunity for citizens to engage in the decision-making process and have their say on matters that affect them. Here's a breakdown of your questions:

1. **What is a public consultation?**
   A public consultation is a process where decision-makers actively seek and consider the views of the public before making a decision. It can take many forms, such as:
   - Online surveys or questionnaires
   - Public meetings or hearings
   - Focus groups or workshops
   - Written submissions or comments
   - Petitions or e-petitions

2. **How can I participate?**
   - **Find consultations**: Keep an eye on local government websites, newspapers, or social media for announcements about public consultations. You can also check dedicated platforms like yoursay.cyprustalk.com (for Cyprus) or, for international consultations, the European Commission's Have Your Say platform (ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say_en).
   - **Understand the topic**: Make sure you understand the issue at hand. Research it thoroughly to ensure your input is well-informed and relevant.
   - **Provide your input**: Once you've found a consultation you're interested in, follow the instructions to submit your feedback. Be clear, concise, and respectful.
   - **Spread the word**: Encourage others to participate as well. The more diverse the input, the better the decision-making process.

3. **What are the benefits of participating?**
   - **Influence decisions**: Your input can help shape policies and projects that affect your life and community.
   - **Learn and engage**: Participating in consultations can help you learn

Q5_56_ I am 14 years old and from Cyprus. I know a little about The European Youth Week or the European Youth Event. Can you tell me more about this? What is it? What is the purpose? How can I participate?

Q5_59_ I am 14 years old and from Cyprus. I know  about European Citizens’ Initiative. Can you tell me more about this? What is it? How can I participate? What are the benefits?

The European Citizens’ Initiative (ECI) is a unique tool for EU citizens to participate directly in the EU’s democratic life. It allows you to call on the European Commission to propose new legislation in areas where the Commission has the power to do so. Here’s a simple breakdown:

1. **What is the European Citizens’ Initiative (ECI)?**
   - It’s a way for EU citizens to influence EU policy-making.
   - It was introduced in 2012 as part of the Treaty of Lisbon to bring EU citizens closer to the EU institutions.
   - It allows EU citizens to propose new legislation in areas where the European Commission has the power to propose laws.

2. **How can you participate?**
   - **Start an ECI**: You can start an ECI if you are a citizen of an EU country and you are part of a citizens’ committee of at least seven people from at least seven different EU countries. You need to register your ECI with the European Commission and collect signatures from at least one million EU citizens from at least seven different EU countries within one year.
   - **Support an ECI**: You can also support an ECI by signing it. You can do this online or on a paper form. You need to be an EU citizen and you can only sign one ECI at a time.

3. **What are the benefits?**
   - **Direct Influence**: The ECI gives you a direct say in EU policy-making. If an ECI collects enough signatures, the European Commission has to examine it and decide whether to propose legislation.
   - **Democracy**: It promotes democracy by allowing citizens to participate directly in the EU’s decision-making process.
   - **Awareness**: It raises awareness about important issues and encourages debate among EU citizens.
   - **Learning Opportunity**: Participating in an ECI can be a great learning experience, helping you
