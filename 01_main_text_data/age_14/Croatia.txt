Q3_30_ I am 14 years old and from Croatia. I have never taken part in activities that relate to democratic participation because I don’t understand the issues enough. For my friends, this is not at all the same. Can you tell me more about how I can do that? How can I get involved in democratic participation?

Democratic participation is a crucial aspect of a healthy society, and it's great that you're interested in getting involved. Here are some ways you can start engaging in democratic participation, even at your age:

1. **Educate Yourself**: The first step is to learn about the issues that matter to you and your community. This could be anything from local environmental concerns to global issues like climate change or social justice. Here are some resources to help you:
   - News websites and apps (like BBC News, The Guardian, or local news portals)
   - Documentaries and educational videos on platforms like YouTube, Netflix, or TED Talks
   - Books and articles on topics you're interested in

2. **Join Clubs or Groups**: Look for clubs or groups at your school or in your community that focus on issues you care about. This could be anything from environmental conservation to human rights. These groups often provide opportunities for activism and advocacy.

3. **Attend Local Meetings**: Many local governments have meetings that are open to the public. Attending these meetings can give you a firsthand look at how decisions are made and how you can have a say in them. You can find information about these meetings on your local government's website or by contacting them directly.

4. **Volunteer**: Volunteering for local organizations or campaigns can be a great way to get involved in democratic participation. This could involve anything from helping with a community clean-up to working on a political campaign.

5. **Write Letters or Petitions**: Writing letters to local officials or starting petitions can be an effective way to voice your concerns and advocate for change. You can use platforms like Change.org to start petitions, and you can find contact information for local officials on their official websites.

6. **Engage on Social Media**: Many organizations and campaigns have a strong online presence. Following them on social media can help you stay informed and
Q3_31_ I am 14 years old and from Croatia. I have never taken part in activities that relate to democratic participation because Nobody has ever asked or invited me to take part. For my friends, this is a little the same. Can you tell me more about how I can do that? I would like to be more involved in my community and to have a say in what happens in my city.

Dear friend,

It's wonderful to hear that you're interested in getting more involved in your community and having a say in what happens in your city. Here are some steps you can take to start your journey towards democratic participation:

1. **Educate Yourself**: Learn about your local government, its structure, and how decisions are made. Understand the roles of different institutions, such as the city council, mayor's office, and local NGOs. This knowledge will help you identify where you can make the most impact.

2. **Join Youth Organizations**: Look for local youth organizations, clubs, or councils that focus on civic engagement. These groups often provide opportunities for young people to voice their opinions and participate in decision-making processes. If there are none in your area, consider starting one with your friends.

3. **Attend Local Meetings and Events**: Participate in public meetings, town halls, and community events. These are great opportunities to learn about what's happening in your city and to share your thoughts and ideas. Some meetings might have age restrictions, but many cities have youth advisory councils or other groups that allow young people to participate.

4. **Volunteer**: Volunteering is a fantastic way to get involved in your community. It allows you to meet new people, learn new skills, and make a positive impact. Look for local volunteering opportunities that align with your interests and passions.

5. **Start a Petition or Campaign**: If there's an issue you care deeply about, consider starting a petition or campaign to raise awareness and advocate for change. Websites like Change.org make it easy to create and share petitions. Remember to follow up with local officials and share your petition with them.

6. **Engage on Social Media**: Follow your local government and community leaders on social media. Engage with their posts by liking, sharing, and commenting

Q3_33_ I am 14 years old and from Croatia. I have never taken part in activities that relate to democratic participation because These activities are too far away.

Dear friend,

It's great to hear that you're interested in democratic participation! Even though it might seem challenging to get involved due to geographical constraints, there are still many ways you can engage in democratic activities. Here are some suggestions:

1. **Online Platforms**: Many organizations and governments now offer online platforms for civic engagement. You can participate in online forums, sign petitions, or even vote in some cases. Some examples include:
   - Avaaz (www.avaaz.org): An online campaigning platform that allows you to sign petitions and participate in online actions.
   - Change.org (www.change.org): A platform where you can start or sign petitions on various issues.
   - Your local government's website: Many local governments have online platforms for public consultations and engagement.

2. **Local Youth Organizations**: Check if there are any youth organizations or NGOs in your local area that focus on democratic participation, human rights, or environmental issues. They often have activities and projects that you can join.

3. **School Activities**: Your school might have clubs or groups that focus on social issues, human rights, or environmental protection. Joining these can be a great way to start engaging in democratic participation.

4. **Volunteering**: Volunteering for local causes can also be a form of democratic participation. It shows that you care about your community and want to make a difference.

5. **Social Media**: Platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram can be used to raise awareness about issues you care about. You can join groups, share posts, and engage in discussions.

6. **Write to Your Representatives**: You can write letters or emails to your local representatives to express your views on issues that matter to you. This is a direct form of democratic participation.

7. **Educate Yourself**: Understanding how democracy works and your rights as a citizen is the first step towards participating in democratic activities.

Q5_51_ I am 14 years old and from Croatia. I know not at all about Citizens’ dialogue, EU Youth Dialogue or EU Youth Conference. Can you tell me more about this? I am interested in this topic.

Dear friend,

I'm glad to hear about your interest in the EU Youth Dialogue and Citizens' Dialogue! These initiatives are great opportunities for young people like you to have a say in shaping the future of Europe. Let me explain them in a bit more detail:

1. **EU Youth Dialogue**: This is a platform for young people to express their views and ideas on topics that matter to them. It's a way for the European Union (EU) to listen to and engage with young people, helping to ensure that their voices are taken into account in EU policy-making. Here's how it works:

   - **EU Youth Conferences**: These are annual events where around 100 young people from all EU Member States come together to discuss and vote on key topics. The results of these conferences are then presented to EU decision-makers.

   - **National Working Groups**: In each EU country, there are national working groups where young people can discuss and prepare for the EU Youth Conferences.

   - **Online Consultations**: The EU also runs online consultations where anyone aged 13-30 can share their views on various topics.

2. **Citizens' Dialogues**: These are public events organized by the European Commission to give citizens the opportunity to discuss EU policies and priorities with Commissioners and other high-level EU representatives. They are open to everyone, regardless of age, and are a great way to learn more about the EU and have your say on its future.

As a 14-year-old from Croatia, you might not be able to participate in all aspects of these dialogues yet (some events have age limits), but there are still plenty of ways for you to get involved:

- **Join a national working group**: Even if you're under 18, you can still join a national working group to discuss and prepare for the EU Youth Conferences. This is a great way to meet other young people from your country

Q5_53_ I am 14 years old and from Croatia. I know kind of about European elections. Can you tell me more about this? What are they and how do they work?

The European Parliament elections, also known as the European elections, are a democratic process that takes place every five years to elect the members of the European Parliament (EP). The EP is the legislative branch of the European Union (EU), and it plays a crucial role in shaping EU policies and laws. Here's a simplified explanation of how the European elections work:

1. **Who can vote and run for election?**
   - EU citizens: Any EU citizen who is at least 18 years old (the voting age varies by country) can vote in the European elections, regardless of their country of residence. They can also run for election in the country where they live.
   - Non-EU citizens: Some EU countries also allow long-term resident non-EU citizens to vote and run for election in European elections. However, this is not a universal right and depends on the specific rules of each member state.

2. **How are the candidates elected?**
   - The European elections use a system of proportional representation. This means that the number of seats a political party wins in the EP is proportional to the number of votes it receives.
   - Each EU member state has a certain number of seats in the EP, allocated based on its population. The exact number of seats per country ranges from 6 to 96.
   - In most countries, political parties present lists of candidates, and voters choose a party rather than individual candidates. Some countries, however, use a system where voters can choose individual candidates from a party list.
   - After the elections, the political groups in the EP (which are formed based on political ideology rather than nationality) elect the President of the European Commission, who is then approved by the EP and appointed by the European Council.

3. **What does the European Parliament do?**
   - The EP has several key roles in the EU's legislative process:
     - It adopts or rejects EU laws, together

Q5_59_ I am 14 years old and from Croatia. I know not at all about European Citizens’ Initiative. Can you tell me more about this? What is it? How can I participate? What are the benefits of this initiative?

The European Citizens’ Initiative (ECI) is a unique tool for EU citizens to participate directly in the EU policy-making process. It was introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon in 2009 and allows EU citizens to propose new legislation in areas where the European Commission has the power to propose laws. Here’s a simple breakdown:

1. **What is the European Citizens’ Initiative (ECI)?**
   - It’s a way for EU citizens to propose new legislation in areas where the European Commission has the power to propose laws.
   - It’s a tool for citizens to express their opinion on issues they care about and to influence EU policy-making.

2. **How does it work?**
   - To launch an ECI, you need to be a citizen of the EU and have the support of at least one million EU citizens from at least seven different Member States.
   - Once an ECI is launched, it has one year to collect signatures. If it reaches the target, the European Commission must acknowledge the ECI and give a formal response within three months.
   - The Commission can decide to follow up on the ECI by proposing legislation, or it can explain why it won’t. In the latter case, the European Parliament and the Council of the EU can still decide to take action.

3. **How can you participate?**
   - You can support an ongoing ECI by signing it. You can find a list of ongoing ECIs on the European Commission’s website.
   - If you have an idea for a new ECI, you can start one yourself. You’ll need to form a committee of at least seven citizens from at least seven different Member States, and you’ll need to follow a specific process to register your ECI.

4. **Benefits of the ECI:**
   - It gives EU citizens a direct say in EU policy-making.
