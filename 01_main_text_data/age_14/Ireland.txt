Q1_4_ I am 14 years old and from Ireland. I think that to make my voice heard Contacting a politician about an issue is not at all effective. Can you give me more ways of doing this? I am interested in climate change and I want to do something about it.

You're absolutely right that contacting a politician is just one way to make your voice heard, and there are many other effective strategies you can use to raise awareness about climate change. Here are some suggestions tailored to your age and situation:

1. **Educate Yourself and Others:**
   - Learn as much as you can about climate change, its causes, effects, and potential solutions. This will help you communicate effectively with others.
   - Share what you've learned with your friends, family, and classmates. You can organize informal discussions, create presentations, or start a climate club at your school.

2. **Join or Start a Youth Climate Group:**
   - Look for existing youth climate groups in your area, such as local branches of Fridays For Future, Extinction Rebellion, or other environmental organizations.
   - If there are no groups nearby, consider starting your own. You can connect with other young people who share your passion and work together to create change.

3. **Participate in Climate Protests and Strikes:**
   - Join global climate strikes and protests, such as those organized by Fridays For Future. These events help raise awareness and put pressure on policymakers.
   - If you can't attend a protest, you can still show your support by sharing information about the event on social media or creating your own mini-protest, like a solo strike or a small gathering with friends.

4. **Engage with Local Media:**
   - Write letters to the editor or opinion pieces for your local newspaper, or create videos for local news websites.

Q3_30_ I am 14 years old and from Ireland. I have never taken part in activities that relate to democratic participation because I donât understand the issues enough.

Firstly, itâs great that youâre interested in getting more involved in your community and understanding the issues better. Here are some steps you can take to start your journey:

Dear [Name],

It's wonderful to hear that you're interested in democratic participation! At your age, there are many ways you can get involved and make your voice heard. Here are some suggestions tailored to your situation:

1. **School Council/Student Council**: If your school doesn't have one, consider starting a student council. This is a great way to represent your peers and have a say in school decisions. You can also join existing school clubs or societies that focus on social issues, politics, or current affairs.

2. **Youth Parliament**: Ireland has a Youth Parliament called 'ComÃ³rad Gaeilge' which gives young people the opportunity to discuss and debate issues that matter to them. They also have regional youth councils and forums where you can get involved.

3. **Local Youth Services**: Check out local youth services in your area. They often run workshops, projects, and events that encourage young people to engage with their communities and local politics.

4. **Online Platforms**: Websites like 'Make Your Mark' by the British Youth Council allow young people to vote on issues they care about and have their say on the future of the UK. While it's not specific to Ireland, it might give you some ideas for similar platforms in Ireland.

5. **Volunteering**: Volunteering for local charities, community groups, or political parties can also be a great way to get involved. It shows that you care about your community and want to make a difference.

6. **Social Media**: Use social media platforms to raise awareness about issues you care about. You can join online campaigns, share relevant content, and engage with others who share your interests.

7. **Write to Your Local Representatives**: You can write to your local TDs (Teachta DÃ¡la), Senators, or MEPs to share your thoughts on issues that matter to you. They represent you, so it's important that they hear your voice.

8. **
Q3_33_ I am 14 years old and from Ireland. I have never taken part in activities that relate to democratic participation because These activities are too far away. It is difficult to get there from my home  (e.g. by public transport). For my friends, this is not at all the same. Can you tell me more about how I can do that? I would like to participate in activities that relate to democratic participation.

I understand that you are interested in participating in democratic activities but are facing some challenges due to your location. Here are some suggestions that might help you:

1. **Online Platforms**: Many organizations now offer online platforms for young people to engage in democratic participation. This could be a great way for you to get involved without having to travel. Some examples include:
   - The European Youth Parliament (EYP) offers online sessions and events.
   - The European Youth Forum has online campaigns and initiatives.
   - Your local council or youth council might also have online platforms for engagement.

2. **Local Activities**: Even if you can't travel far, there might be local activities or events happening in your area. These could be organized by your school, local council, or community groups. Keep an eye out for posters, flyers, or online announcements about these events.

3. **Volunteering**: Volunteering can be a great way to get involved in your community and learn about democratic participation. You could volunteer with local charities, community groups, or environmental organizations. This could also help you develop important skills and gain experience.

4. **School Activities**: Your school might have clubs, societies, or student councils that you can join. These can be a great way to learn about democracy and practice leadership skills.

5. **Online Petitions and Campaigns**: Websites like Change.org allow you to start or sign petitions on issues you care about. This can be a way to participate in democratic processes from home.

6. **Write to Your Representatives**: You can write letters or emails to your local representatives (like your TDs, MEPs, or local councillors) to express your views on issues. This is a direct form of democratic participation.

7. **Youth Organizations**: There might be youth organizations in your area that focus on democratic participation. These could be a great way to meet like-minded people

Q4b_42_ I am 14 years old and from Ireland. I am a little interested in changing society in the area of Health and well-being. Can you tell me how I can do this? I have a few ideas but I am not sure how to go about them. I would really appreciate any help you could give me. Thank you.

Hello! It's wonderful to hear that you're interested in making a positive impact on society, especially in the area of health and well-being. Here are some steps and ideas to help you get started:

1. **Educate Yourself**: Before you start any initiative, it's important to have a solid understanding of the topic. Read books, watch documentaries, and research online to learn about health and well-being. Some recommended books include "The Blue Zones Solution" by Dan Buettner, "How Not to Die" by Michael Greger, and "The Upward Spiral" by Alex Korb.

2. **Identify the Problem**: Clearly define the issue you want to address. Is it mental health awareness, physical fitness, healthy eating habits, or something else? Once you've identified the problem, you can start thinking about solutions.

3. **Set Clear Goals**: What do you hope to achieve? Your goals should be SMART: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. For example, "I want to increase physical activity among my peers by organizing a weekly community walk within the next three months."

4. **Create a Plan**: Break down your goals into smaller, manageable tasks. Here's a simple plan for your weekly community walk:

   - Research suitable walking routes and ensure they're safe and accessible.
   - Create promotional materials (flyers, social media posts) to invite people.
   - Partner with local schools, sports clubs, or community centers to help promote the event.
   - Plan a starting time and duration for the walk.
   - Consider having a theme or a guest speaker to make the event more engaging.

5. **Build a Team**: You don't have to do everything alone. Enlist the help of friends, family,

Q5_51_ I am 14 years old and from Ireland. I know not at all about Citizensâ dialogue, EU Youth Dialogue or EU Youth Conference. Can you tell me more about this? I am interested in learning more about this.

Citizensâ Dialogue, EU Youth Dialogue, and EU Youth Conference are all initiatives organized by the European Union (EU) to engage citizens, particularly young people, in discussions and decision-making processes related to EU policies and priorities. Hereâs a brief overview of each:

1. **Citizensâ Dialogues**: These are public events organized by the European Commission, often in partnership with local authorities or other organizations. The aim is to bring together EU citizens to discuss and exchange views on EU policies and initiatives. Topics can range from the economy and employment to climate change, digitalization, or the future of Europe. These dialogues help the EU to understand citizensâ concerns and expectations, and they provide an opportunity for citizens to learn more about the EU and how it affects their daily lives. You can find more information on the European Commissionâs website: https://ec.europa.eu/citizens-initative/our-europe-citizens-dialogues_en

2. **EU Youth Dialogue**: This is a structured dialogue between young people and EU institutions. It aims to give young people a say in matters that concern them and to influence EU policies on youth. The dialogue is organized in several phases, including national consultations, a European Youth Event (EYE) held in Strasbourg, and a follow-up process where the outcomes are presented to EU decision-makers. The EU Youth Dialogue covers a wide range of topics, such as education, employment, participation, and mobility. You can find more information on the European Commissionâs website: https://ec.europa.eu/youth/policy/youth-dialogue_en

3. **EU Youth Conference**: This is the final stage of the EU Youth Dialogue process. It brings together young people from all EU Member States to present their recommendations to EU decision-makers. The conference is an opportunity for young people to discuss and agree on common priorities and to make concrete recommendations for EU action. The outcomes
Q5_52_ I am 14 years old and from Ireland. I know not at all about Public consultations. Can you tell me more about this? I am interested in the topic of climate change and I want to know how I can get involved in this topic.

Public consultations are a way for the government, organizations, or other bodies to gather information and opinions from the public on a particular topic or issue. In the context of climate change, public consultations can be a great way for you to have your voice heard and contribute to the conversation.

Here are some ways you can get involved in climate change through public consultations:

1. **Government Consultations**: Many governments around the world hold public consultations on various policies and initiatives related to climate change. These can range from national policies to local plans. You can check your local government's website for any ongoing or upcoming consultations. For example, in Ireland, the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications often holds public consultations on environmental topics.

2. **Organizational Consultations**: Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and other bodies working on climate change may also hold public consultations. These could be focused on specific projects, campaigns, or research. Examples include Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth, or local environmental groups.

3. **Online Platforms**: Some organizations and governments use online platforms to gather public input. These can be in the form of surveys, online forums, or social media campaigns. Websites like Climate Feedback or Our Climate Voices allow you to share your thoughts and engage with others on climate change.

4. **School and Community Initiatives**: You can also start or participate in local initiatives. This could be through your school, community groups, or local environmental action groups. These can be a great way to learn more about climate change and how to take action.

5. **Youth-Led Initiatives**: There are many youth-led initiatives focused on climate change. These can provide a space for you to connect with others your age, learn, and take action. Examples include the Fridays For Future movement inspired by Greta Thunberg, or local youth environmental groups
Q5_53_ I am 14 years old and from Ireland. I know a little about European elections. Can you tell me more about this? I am interested in politics and I want to know more about the European elections.

The European Parliament elections are a set of elections held every five years since 1999 to elect the 751 members of the European Parliament (MEPs). These elections are held in all EU member states over a period of four days, with the results being announced after the voting has concluded in all member states.

The European Parliament is one of the two legislative bodies of the European Union, along with the Council of the European Union. It has the power to propose and amend legislation, as well as to scrutinize the work of the European Commission, which is the executive branch of the EU.

The European Parliament is composed of political groups rather than national delegations. These groups are formed by MEPs from different member states who share similar political views. The largest political group in the European Parliament is currently the European People's Party (EPP), which is a center-right group.

The European Parliament elections are an opportunity for EU citizens to have a say in the direction of the EU and to elect MEPs who will represent their interests in the European Parliament. The elections are also seen as a way for EU citizens to express their views on the state of the EU and the direction it should take.

In Ireland, the European Parliament elections are held using a system of proportional representation by means of the single transferable vote (PR-STV). This means that voters can express a preference for individual candidates as well as for political parties. The elections are held in four constituencies, with each constituency electing four MEPs.

I hope this information helps you understand more about the European elections. If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to ask. It's great to see young people taking an interest in politics and the European Union.

Q5_55_ I am 14 years old and from Ireland. I know not at all about Visit of the EU institutions. Can you tell me more about this? Thank you.

The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of 27 member states that are primarily located in Europe. The EU has several institutions that play a crucial role in its governance and decision-making processes. Here are some of the key EU institutions and their roles:

1. **European Commission**: Often referred to as the "guardian of the treaties," the European Commission is the executive branch of the EU. It is responsible for proposing legislation, implementing policies, and enforcing EU laws. The Commission is led by a President and consists of 27 Commissioners, each representing one member state.

2. **European Council**: The European Council provides the EU with its general political direction and impetus. It is composed of the heads of state or government of the EU member states, along with the President of the European Commission and the President of the European Council. The European Council meets at least four times a year.

3. **Council of the European Union**: The Council of the EU is the EU's main decision-making body. It is composed of government ministers from each EU country, depending on the policy area being discussed. The Council is responsible for adopting laws and coordinating policies among member states.

4. **European Parliament**: The European Parliament is the only directly elected EU institution. It has legislative power, along with the Council, and provides democratic accountability for EU policies. MEPs (Members of the European Parliament) are elected every five years by EU citizens.

5. **European Court of Justice (ECJ)**: The ECJ interprets EU law to ensure it is applied in the same way in all member states. It also settles disputes between EU institutions, member states, and EU citizens or companies.

6. **European Central Bank (ECB)**: The ECB is responsible for managing the euro, the currency of 19 EU member states. It sets monetary policy for the eurozone and aims to maintain price stability.

7. **Court
Q5_56_ I am 14 years old and from Ireland. I know not at all about The European Youth Week or the European Youth Event. Can you tell me more about this? I am interested in politics and would like to know more about the EU.

The European Youth Week and the European Youth Event are initiatives organized by the European Parliament to engage young people in the democratic process and to raise awareness about the European Union and its institutions. Here's a brief overview of both events:

1. **European Youth Week (EYW)**: This is an annual event that takes place in April or May, coinciding with Europe Day (May 9). The EYW aims to celebrate young people's achievements and to encourage them to participate in democratic life. It brings together young people from across Europe to discuss and debate topics that are important to them, such as education, employment, digitalization, and the environment. The week-long event includes workshops, debates, and cultural activities. It's a great opportunity for young people to learn about the EU, its policies, and how they can influence decision-making processes.

2. **European Youth Event (EYE)**: The EYE is a biennial event that takes place in the European Parliament in Strasbourg. It's a unique opportunity for young people to engage directly with EU decision-makers, including Members of the European Parliament (MEPs). The event includes workshops, debates, and simulations of EU decision-making processes. Young people can also propose and vote on ideas for the future of Europe. The EYE is a great way to learn about the EU's institutions, policies, and how to participate in the democratic process.

Both events are open to young people aged 16-30. They are excellent opportunities to learn about the EU, meet other young people from across Europe, and have your voice heard. If you're interested in politics and the EU, I would highly recommend keeping an eye out for these events and considering applying to participate.

Dear [Name],

It's great to hear that you're interested in engaging with your local representatives about climate change! Here's a step-by-step guide on how to contact a Commissioner and an MEP, along with some tips on what to say:

1. **Finding the right person:**
   - **European Commissioners:** The European Commission has 27 Commissioners, each responsible for a specific policy area. You can find the list of Commissioners and their portfolios here: <https://ec.europa.eu/commission/president/commissioners_en>
   - **MEPs (Members of the European Parliament):** To find your local MEP, you can use the "Find your MEP" tool on the European Parliament's website: <https://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/search.html>

2. **Contacting them:**
   - **Commissioners:** You can send an email to the Commissioner's private office using the contact form available on their profile page. You can also write a letter and send it to the Commissioner's private office at the following address:
     European Commission
     [Commissioner's Name]
     B-1049 Brussels
     Belgium
   - **MEPs:** You can find the contact details for each MEP on their profile page. They usually provide an email address and a postal address. Some MEPs also have a contact form on their website.

3. **What to say:**
   - Be clear and concise: Start by introducing yourself and explain why you're writing to them.
   - Be specific: Mention the climate change issue you're concerned about (e.g., deforestation, renewable energy, climate policy, etc.).
   - Provide evidence: Back up your points with facts, statistics, or examples to show that you're well-informed
