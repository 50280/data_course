Q3_30_ I am 14 years old and from Lithuania. I have never taken part in activities that relate to democratic participation because I don’t understand the issues enough. For my friends, this is kind of the same. Can you tell me more about how I can do that? What are the ways to participate in democratic processes?

Democratic participation is a crucial aspect of a healthy society, and it's great that you're interested in getting involved. Here are some ways you can participate in democratic processes, even at your age:

1. **Educate Yourself**: The first step is to learn about the issues that matter to you and your community. This could be anything from local school policies to global climate change. Read newspapers, watch news programs, and use reliable online sources to stay informed.

2. **Join Clubs or Organizations**: Many schools have clubs or organizations that focus on social issues, politics, or current events. Joining these can help you learn more and connect with like-minded peers. If your school doesn't have any, consider starting one.

3. **Attend Local Meetings**: Many local governments have meetings that are open to the public. Attending these can give you a firsthand look at how decisions are made. You might not be able to vote yet, but your voice can still be heard in the public comment sections.

5. **Write Letters or Opinion Pieces**: Writing to your local representatives or submitting opinion pieces to local newspapers can be a powerful way to express your views and influence decision-making.

6. **Participate in Online Discussions**: Many platforms have online forums or social media groups dedicated to political discussions. These can be a great way to learn from others and share your own views.

Citizens’ Dialogue, EU Youth Dialogue, and EU Youth Conference are all initiatives organized by the European Union (EU) to encourage young people to engage in democratic processes and have their voices heard on various topics. Here’s a brief overview of each:

1. **Citizens’ Dialogue**: This is a series of public events organized by the European Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen, and other EU institutions. The aim is to bring together EU citizens and policymakers to discuss EU policies and priorities. These dialogues provide an opportunity for citizens to ask questions, share their views, and engage in a conversation with EU representatives. They are open to people of all ages, but they often include youth-specific sessions or events.

2. **EU Youth Dialogue**: This is a structured dialogue process between young people and EU institutions. It aims to give young people a say in EU policy-making and to ensure that their needs and expectations are taken into account. The EU Youth Dialogue focuses on topics that are important to young people, such as education, employment, participation, and social inclusion. It involves a series of events and activities at local, national, and EU levels, including:

   - **EU Youth Conferences**: These are annual events where young people from all EU Member States come together to discuss and vote on policy recommendations. The results are then presented to EU policymakers.

   - **EU Youth Dialogue Events**: These are smaller-scale events that take place throughout the year, focusing on specific topics or regions.

   - **EU Youth Goals**: These are a set of eight goals that young people have identified as priorities for EU action. They were developed through the EU Youth Dialogue process and cover areas like education, employment, participation, and health.

3. **EU Youth Conference**: As mentioned earlier, this is an annual event that brings together young people from all EU Member States to discuss and vote on policy recommendations. The conference

It's great to hear that you're interested in engaging with European politics and raising awareness about climate change. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to contact a Commissioner or a Member of the European Parliament (MEP):

1. **Find the relevant Commissioner:**
   The European Commission is the executive branch of the EU, and it's responsible for proposing and enforcing legislation. The Commissioner for Climate Action and Energy is the most relevant for your topic. You can find their contact details here: https://ec.europa.eu/commission/commissioners/2019-2024/kadri-simson_en

   You can also find other Commissioners and their contact details here: https://ec.europa.eu/commission/index_en

2. **Find your MEP:**
   MEPs are directly elected by EU citizens and represent them in the European Parliament. You can find your MEP and their contact details using this tool: https://www.yourmeps.eu/

   Once you've found your MEP, you can contact them via email, post, or social media. Some MEPs also have online contact forms on their official websites.

3. **Prepare your message:**
   - Be clear and concise. Explain who you are, where you're from, and what you're writing about.
   - Explain why you're concerned about climate change and what you'd like them to do about it. Be specific – do you want them to support a particular piece of legislation, raise awareness, or take some other action?
   - Include any relevant information or facts to support your argument.
   - Be polite and respectful.

4. **Send your message:**
   - For Commissioners, you can usually find an email address or a contact form on their official EU webpage.
   - For MEPs, you can use the contact details you found on the 'Your MEPs'
Q5_58_ I am 14 years old and from Lithuania. I know not at all about Participation in events organised by the EU in your country. Can you tell me more about this? What are the benefits of participating in such events? What are the requirements? How can I participate?

Participating in events organised by the EU can be a great way to learn about European policies, meet people from different countries, and gain new skills and experiences. Here are some ways you can participate:

1. **EU-funded programmes and events**: The EU offers various programmes and events for young people, such as:
   - **Erasmus+**: This programme offers opportunities for young people to study, train, gain work experience, and volunteer abroad. It also supports youth exchanges and other events that promote mobility and cooperation between countries.
   - **European Youth Events**: These are large-scale events that bring together young people from across Europe to discuss and debate European issues. Examples include the European Youth Event (EYE) in Strasbourg and the European Youth Forum.
   - **EU-funded projects**: Many non-profit organisations and local authorities receive EU funding to implement projects that involve young people. These projects can cover a wide range of topics, from environmental protection to digital literacy.

2. **Local and national events**: Many EU Member States organise local and national events to engage young people in EU policies and initiatives. These can include workshops, debates, and other activities. Check with your local municipality or youth organisations to find out about events in your area.

3. **Online participation**: The EU also offers opportunities for young people to participate online, such as through consultations, surveys, and social media campaigns. For example, the European Commission's "Have Your Say" platform allows young people to share their ideas and opinions on various EU policies.

**Benefits of participating**:

* Gain a better understanding of EU policies and how they affect your life
* Develop new skills, such as communication, teamwork, and problem-solving
* Meet and collaborate with young people from other countries
* Enhance your CV and improve your chances of finding a job or getting into university
* Make a difference
Q5_59_ I am 14 years old and from Lithuania. I know not at all about European Citizens’ Initiative. Can you tell me more about this? What is it? How can I participate? What are the benefits of it?

The European Citizens’ Initiative (ECI) is a unique tool for EU citizens to participate directly in the EU policy-making process. It was introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon in 2009 and has been in operation since 2012. Here’s a simple breakdown to help you understand it:

1. **What is the European Citizens’ Initiative?**
   The ECI is a way for citizens of the European Union to call on the European Commission to propose new legislation on issues that concern them. It’s a way for EU citizens to have a direct say in EU policies.

2. **How does it work?**
   - **Collecting signatures**: To launch an ECI, you need to form a citizens’ committee of at least 7 EU citizens from at least 7 different EU Member States. The committee then has one year to collect at least one million signatures from EU citizens in at least 7 different Member States. These signatures must be collected using the official ECI platform.
   - **Review by the Commission**: Once the signatures are collected, the European Commission reviews the initiative. If it’s relevant for EU action and falls within the Commission’s competences, the Commission will decide whether to propose legislation or not. If the Commission decides not to act, it must explain its reasons to the European Parliament and the Council.

3. **How can you participate?**
   - **Support an ongoing ECI**: You can support an ongoing ECI by signing it on the official ECI platform. You need to be an EU citizen and resident in one of the EU Member States.
   - **Start your own ECI**: If you have an issue you want to raise, you can start your own ECI. You’ll need to form a citizens’ committee and follow the steps outlined above.
