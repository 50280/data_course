1. **Education and Awareness**: Learn about the issues you care about and share your knowledge with others. This can be done through social media, creating blog posts, or even giving presentations at school. The more people are aware of a problem, the more likely they are to support its solution.

2. **Volunteer**: Many organizations are always looking for volunteers to help with their causes. This could be anything from helping at a local animal shelter to participating in beach clean-ups.

Q3_30_ I am 14 years old and from Austria. I have never taken part in activities that relate to democratic participation because I don’t understand the issues enough. For my friends, this is kind of the same. Can you tell me more about how I can do that? I would like to be more involved in the democratic process.

Thank you for your question. It’s great to hear that you’re interested in getting more involved in the democratic process! Here are some ways you can start:

1. **Educate Yourself**: The first step is to learn about the issues that matter to you. This could be anything from climate change, to education, to social justice. Read articles, watch documentaries, and talk to people to gain a better understanding of these topics.

2. **Join a Club or Group**: Look for clubs or groups at your school or in your community that focus on issues you care about. This could be an environmental club, a social justice group, or a political party youth wing. These groups can provide a great way to connect with like-minded people and learn more about how to make a difference.

3. **Attend Local Meetings**: Many local governments have meetings that are open to the public. Attending these meetings can give you a firsthand look at how decisions are made and how you can have a say in them. You can also meet local politicians and other community members.

4. **Volunteer**: Volunteering for a cause you believe in can be a great way to get involved. It can also give you a better understanding of the issues and how you can help make a difference.

5. **Vote**: Once you're old enough, voting is one of the most important ways to participate in democracy. Make sure you're registered to vote and that you understand the issues and candidates on the ballot.

6. **Start a Petition or Campaign**: If there's an issue you're passionate about, consider starting a petition or campaign to raise awareness and bring about change. Websites like Change.org make it easy to start a petition.

7. **Talk to Your Peers**: Encourage your friends to get involved too. The more people who care about an issue and take action, the more likely it is that

Q3_32_ I am 14 years old and from Austria. I have never taken part in activities that relate to democratic participation because I did not know that I could do this. For my friends, this is a lot the same. Can you tell me more about how I can do that? I would like to do something for my community.

Thank you for your question. It's great to hear that you're interested in getting involved in your community and democratic participation. Here are some ways you can do that, even at your age:

1. **Youth Councils or Youth Parliaments**: Many cities and towns have youth councils or youth parliaments where young people can voice their opinions and ideas. These groups often work on projects that benefit the local community. Check if your city has one and how you can join.

2. **School Activities**: Your school might have student councils or other groups where you can participate in decision-making processes. If not, you could start one. You could also organize events or initiatives that address issues you care about, like environmental protection, mental health awareness, or anti-bullying campaigns.

3. **Volunteering**: Volunteering is a great way to give back to your community. You could help at local charities, animal shelters, or community centers. This can also help you develop important skills and gain experience.

4. **Online Petitions and Campaigns**: Websites like Change.org allow you to start or sign petitions about issues you care about. You can also participate in online campaigns and raise awareness about important topics.

5. **Local Elections**: In Austria, you can vote in local elections from the age of 16. This is a direct way to participate in democracy. You can also help with election campaigns or run for a position yourself.

6. **Environmental Initiatives**: You could start or join a local environmental initiative. This could involve cleaning up litter, planting trees, or advocating for better recycling facilities.

7. **Art and Creativity**: You can use your artistic talents to raise awareness about issues you care about. This could be through posters, murals, music, or other forms of art.

8. **Dialogue and Debate**: Join or start a debate club at your school.
Q3_33_ I am 14 years old and from Austria. I have never taken part in activities that relate to democratic participation because These activities are too far away. It is difficult to get there from my home  (e.g. by public transport). For my friends, this is a lot the same. Can you tell me more about how I can do that? I would like to participate in democratic activities.

Dear friend,

It's great to hear that you're interested in participating in democratic activities! While it's true that some events may be far away, there are still many ways you can get involved and make your voice heard. Here are some suggestions:

1. **Online Platforms**: Many organizations and governments now offer online platforms for young people to engage in democratic processes. These can include online forums, surveys, or even virtual town halls. Some examples include:
   - The European Youth Portal: <https://europa.eu/youth/portal_en>
   - The European Youth Dialogue: <https://ec.europa.eu/youth/participation/youth-dialogue_en>
   - Your local or national government's youth engagement platforms

2. **Local Youth Councils or Youth Parliaments**: These are often set up by local governments to give young people a say in local decision-making. Even if you can't physically attend meetings, some may offer online participation options. Check with your local municipality to see if they have one.

3. **School Activities**: Your school might have clubs or groups focused on social issues, politics, or debating. These can be a great way to start engaging with democratic processes and learning about different perspectives.

4. **Volunteering and Activism**: You can also participate in democratic processes by getting involved in local community projects, volunteering for causes you care about, or joining activism groups. This can help you understand the issues that matter to your community and how you can influence change.

5. **Social Media**: Many organizations and politicians use social media to engage with young people. Following them and participating in online discussions can be a way to make your voice heard.

6. **Write to Your Representatives**: You can write letters or emails to your local, regional, or national representatives to share your thoughts on issues that matter to you. They are there to represent you, after all!

Q5_51_ I am 14 years old and from Austria. I know not at all about Citizens’ dialogue, EU Youth Dialogue or EU Youth Conference. Can you tell me more about this? I am interested in the topic of climate change and would like to participate in the EU Youth Dialogue.

The EU Youth Dialogue is a platform for young people to express their views and ideas on topics that are important to them. It is a way for young people to have a say in the decisions that affect their lives. The EU Youth Dialogue is organized by the European Commission and is open to young people aged 15-30.

The EU Youth Dialogue is organized in three phases:

1. National consultations: In each EU member state, national consultations are organized to gather the views and ideas of young people on the topic of the year. These consultations are organized by national youth councils or other youth organizations.
2. EU Youth Conference: The results of the national consultations are presented at the EU Youth Conference, which is organized by the European Commission. At this conference, young people from all EU member states come together to discuss the topic of the year and to make recommendations to the European Commission.
3. Follow-up: After the EU Youth Conference, the European Commission follows up on the recommendations made by the young people. It reports back to the young people on the actions it has taken and the progress made on the topic of the year.

The topic of the year for the EU Youth Dialogue 2022 is "Climate change and environmental degradation". This is a great opportunity for you to have your say on this important topic and to make a difference.

To participate in the EU Youth Dialogue, you can:

* Check the website of the European Commission for more information on the EU Youth Dialogue and the upcoming events.
* Contact your national youth council or other youth organizations in your country to find out about national consultations on the topic of climate change and environmental degradation.
* Follow the EU Youth Dialogue on social media to stay up-to-date on the latest news and events.

I hope this information is helpful! Let me know if you have any other questions.

Q5_55_ I am 14 years old and from Austria. I know not at all about Visit of the EU institutions. Can you tell me more about this? Thank you.

The European Union (EU) has several institutions that play a crucial role in its governance and decision-making processes. Here's a brief overview of the main EU institutions and their functions:

1. **European Parliament (EP)**: This is the only directly elected EU institution. Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) are elected every five years by EU citizens. The EP has several powers, including:
   - Legislation: It co-legislates with the Council of the EU on an equal footing.
   - Budget: It approves or rejects the EU's annual budget.
   - Oversight: It scrutinizes other EU institutions and can censure the European Commission.

It proposes new laws, manages the EU's budget, and enforces EU policies. The Commission is led by a President and consists of 27 Commissioners, one from each EU member state.

3. **Council of the European Union (Council)**: The Council represents the governments of the EU member states. It is composed of ministers from each member state, depending on the policy area being discussed (e.g., finance ministers, agriculture ministers, etc.). The Council shares legislative and budgetary powers with the European Parliament.

4. **European Council**: This is where heads of state or government of the EU member states, along with its President and the President of the Commission, meet to provide the EU with strategic guidance and direction. It is not a permanent institution but meets regularly.

5. **European Court of Justice (ECJ)**: The ECJ ensures that EU law is interpreted and applied correctly and uniformly across the EU. It can also rule on disputes between EU institutions, member states, and individuals or companies.

6. **European Central Bank (ECB)**: The ECB is the central bank for the euro area. It is

Q5_57_ I am 14 years old and from Austria. I know not at all about Contacting a Commissioner or an MEP. Can you tell me more about this? I want to contact them because I want to ask them about the EU's climate policy and how I can help. I want to know how I can contact them and what I should write in my email. Thank you for your help!

Dear [Commissioner's or MEP's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to you as a 14-year-old student from Austria who is deeply concerned about the climate crisis and eager to understand more about the EU's climate policy and how I can contribute to its success.

I have been following the news and discussions about climate change and I am inspired by the EU's commitment to becoming the first climate-neutral continent by 2050. I believe that every individual, regardless of age, has a role to play in achieving this goal, and I am eager to do my part.

In your capacity as [Commissioner/MEP], I would greatly appreciate it if you could provide me with more information on the following:

1. What are the key priorities of the EU's climate policy in the coming years?
2. How can young people like me get involved and make a difference in our communities and beyond?
3. Are there any specific initiatives or projects that you would recommend for someone my age who wants to take action on climate change?
4. How can I stay informed about the EU's climate policy and its progress?

I am eager to learn from your expertise and experience, and I hope that my interest in this topic will inspire others my age to take action as well. Thank you for your time and consideration, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards,

[Your Name]

Q5_58_ I am 14 years old and from Austria. I know not at all about Participation in events organised by the EU in your country. Can you tell me more about this? I would like to participate in such an event.

Participating in events organised by the EU in your country can be a great way to learn more about the European Union, its policies, and its impact on your daily life. Here are some ways you can participate:

1. **EU Information Days and Events**: The EU delegation in your country often organises information days, seminars, and workshops on various topics such as EU funding opportunities, youth programmes, or EU policies. These events are usually open to the public and can be a great way to learn more about the EU and engage in discussions. You can find these events on the EU delegation's website or social media channels.

2. **EU-funded Projects**: Many EU-funded projects organise events and activities open to the public. These can range from cultural events, to workshops on environmental issues, to conferences on EU policies. You can find these projects and their events on the EU's funding and tenders portal (https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/implementation-reform_en) or by searching for EU-funded projects in your country.

3. **EU Youth Dialogue**: The EU Youth Dialogue is a platform for young people to have their say on issues that matter to them. It's a great way to participate in EU policy-making. The EU delegation in your country might organise local events or consultations as part of this dialogue. You can find more information on the EU Youth Dialogue website (https://europa.eu/youth/eu-youth-dialogue_en).

4. **EU Competitions and Contests**: The EU often organises competitions and contests open to young people, such as the EU's "Europe in My Region" photo competition or the "EU Prize for Journalism". These can be a fun and creative way to engage with the EU.

5. **EU Information Centres**: Many EU member states have EU Information Centres that provide information on EU policies
Q5_59_ I am 14 years old and from Austria. I know a little about European Citizens’ Initiative. Can you tell me more about this? What is it and how does it work?

The European Citizens’ Initiative (ECI) is a unique tool for EU citizens to participate directly in the EU’s democratic life. It was introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon in 2009 and has been in operation since 2012. Here’s a simple breakdown of how it works:

1. **Who can propose an ECI?**
   - Any EU citizen, or a group of EU citizens, can propose an ECI. You need to be a citizen of an EU country and have the right to vote in European Parliament elections.

2. **What can an ECI be about?**
   - An ECI can be about any area of EU policy, except for areas where the EU has no competence, such as taxation, defense, and social security.

3. **How to start an ECI?**
   - To start an ECI, you need to register your proposal with the European Commission. This involves submitting a proposal form, a statement of reasons, and a declaration of honor. You also need to provide a website where you will collect signatures.

4. **Collecting signatures:**
   - Once your ECI is registered, you have one year to collect at least one million signatures from at least seven different EU countries. The signatures must come from a minimum of 0.2% of the population in each of those countries.
   - You can collect signatures online or on paper. If you collect signatures online, you need to use the official ECI platform. If you collect signatures on paper, you need to follow the rules set out in the ECI Regulation.

5. **What happens after the signatures are collected?**
   - If your ECI collects at least one million signatures within one year, the European Commission will examine your proposal. If it is deemed admissible, the Commission will decide whether to take action or not. If the Commission decides not to take action, it must explain
