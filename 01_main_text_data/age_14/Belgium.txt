Q3_30_ I am 14 years old and from Belgium. I have never taken part in activities that relate to democratic participation because I don’t understand the issues enough. For my friends, this is kind of the same. Can you tell me more about how I can do that? What are the benefits of participating in democratic activities?

Dear 14-year-old,

It's wonderful that you're interested in democratic participation and want to learn more about it. Here are some ways you can get involved and some benefits of doing so:

1. **Educate Yourself**: Start by learning about the political system in Belgium. Understand the roles of different institutions like the Parliament, the Government, and the King. Learn about the political parties and their ideologies. This will help you make informed decisions when it comes to voting or expressing your opinions.

2. **Join a Youth Organization**: Belgium has several youth organizations that focus on political and social issues. These include the JEF (Young European Federalists), the JM Belgium (Young Socialists), and the JK Belgium (Young Christian Democrats). Joining these organizations can help you meet like-minded individuals, learn about different perspectives, and participate in activities that promote democratic values.

3. **Participate in School Activities**: Many schools in Belgium have student councils or other democratic structures. Participating in these can give you hands-on experience with democratic processes. It can also help you develop leadership skills and learn how to advocate for your peers.

4. **Attend Public Meetings and Events**: Many political parties and organizations hold public meetings and events where you can listen to speakers, ask questions, and engage in discussions. These can be a great way to learn about different issues and express your views.

5. **Volunteer**: Volunteering for a cause you care about can be a form of democratic participation. It allows you to contribute to your community and make a difference. It can also help you understand the importance of collective action and the role of civil society in a democracy.

6. **Use Your Voice on Social Media**: While it's important to be cautious about misinformation, social media can be a powerful tool for expressing your opinions and engaging with others. Use it to discuss issues, share news articles, and connect

Dear 14-year-old,

It's wonderful that you're interested in democratic participation! There are many ways you can get involved, even at your age. Here are some suggestions:

1. **School Council or Student Government**: Many schools have student councils or governments where students can voice their opinions and help make decisions. If your school doesn't have one, you could start a petition to create one.

2. **Youth Councils**: Some cities and regions have youth councils where young people can discuss local issues and influence decision-making. Check if there's one in your area.

3. **Volunteering**: This can be a great way to understand and participate in your community. You could volunteer at a local charity, help with community clean-up projects, or assist with events.

4. **Online Petitions and Campaigns**: Websites like Change.org allow you to start or sign petitions on issues you care about. You can also participate in online campaigns and discussions.

5. **Join a Club or Group**: This could be a sports team, a music group, or a club focused on an issue you care about. These can teach you about teamwork, leadership, and advocacy.

6. **Write to Your Representatives**: You can write letters or emails to your local, regional, or national representatives about issues that matter to you. They represent you, so they should hear your voice.

7. **Educate Yourself**: Learn about the political process, current events, and issues that affect you. The more you know, the more you can participate.

8. **Talk to Your Peers**: Discuss these topics with your friends. You might inspire each other to get involved.

Dear 14-year-old,

It's great to hear that you're interested in democratic participation! There are several ways you can get involved, even if you're limited by distance or transportation. Here are some suggestions:

   - **Local Youth Councils or Youth Parliaments**: Some local governments have youth councils or youth parliaments where young people can voice their opinions and influence local decision-making. Check if your municipality has one and if they offer online participation.

Q5_51_ I am 14 years old and from Belgium. I know not at all about Citizens’ dialogue, EU Youth Dialogue or EU Youth Conference. Can you tell me more about this? I am very interested in this topic.

Dear 14-year-old,

It's wonderful to hear about your interest in the EU Youth Dialogue, Citizens' Dialogue, and the EU Youth Conference. These initiatives are designed to engage young people like you in shaping the future of Europe. Let's break down each of these concepts:

1. **EU Youth Dialogue**: This is an ongoing process that aims to involve young people in policy-making at the European level. It's a way for the European Commission to listen to and learn from young people's experiences, ideas, and expectations. The dialogue focuses on various topics, such as education, employment, participation, and digital youth work. Here's how you can get involved:

   - **National level**: Each EU Member State has a national structure for the EU Youth Dialogue. You can find out more about this in Belgium by contacting the Belgian Youth Council (Conseil de la Jeunesse) or the Belgian Federal Public Service for Education and Training.

   - **European level**: The European Youth Forum is the main platform for youth organizations in Europe. They organize events and activities where young people can share their views and ideas with policymakers.

2. **Citizens' Dialogue**: This is a series of events organized by the European Commission to engage with EU citizens and discuss various EU policies and initiatives. These dialogues provide an opportunity for citizens to ask questions, share their views, and learn more about how the EU affects their daily lives. While these events are not specifically targeted at young people, they are open to everyone, including 14-year-olds. You can find out more about upcoming Citizens' Dialogues on the European Commission's website.

3. **EU Youth Conference**: This is an annual event organized by the European Commission and the Council of Europe. It brings together young people from across Europe to discuss and debate youth-related issues and make recommendations to policymakers. The conference is open to young people aged 13-

Q5_55_ I am 14 years old and from Belgium. I know a little about Visit of the EU institutions. Can you tell me more about this? What are the EU institutions and what do they do?

The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of 27 member states that are primarily located in Europe. The EU has several institutions that play a crucial role in its governance and decision-making processes. Here are the main EU institutions and their functions:

1. **European Commission**:
   - The Commission is the executive branch of the EU, responsible for proposing legislation, enforcing EU laws, and managing the day-to-day business of the EU.
   - It is composed of 27 Commissioners, one from each member state, appointed by the Council of the EU in agreement with the European Parliament.
   - The Commission is led by a President, who is elected by the European Parliament with the agreement of the Council of the EU.

2. **European Council**:
   - The European Council provides the EU with its general political direction and impetus.
   - It is composed of the heads of state or government of the EU member states, along with the President of the European Commission and the President of the European Council.
   - The European Council meets at least four times a year to discuss and decide on major policy issues.

3. **Council of the European Union (Council)**:

Q5_56_ I am 14 years old and from Belgium. I know not at all about The European Youth Week or the European Youth Event. Can you tell me more about this? I would like to participate in this event.

The European Youth Week and the European Youth Event (EYE) are initiatives organized by the European Parliament to engage young people in the democratic life of the European Union. Here's a brief overview of both events:

1. **European Youth Week (EYW)**: This is an annual event that takes place in early May. It aims to celebrate and promote youth engagement, participation, and active citizenship across Europe. The EYW is a decentralized event, meaning it's organized locally in each EU Member State by national authorities, with the support of the European Commission. Activities can vary, but they often include workshops, debates, and cultural events focused on topics relevant to young people, such as education, employment, digitalization, and environmental protection.

   To participate, you should check the official EYW website for more information about the events happening in your country: https://europa.eu/youth/week_en

2. **European Youth Event (EYE)**: The EYE is a biennial event held in the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France. It brings together thousands of young people from all over Europe to discuss and debate on various topics related to the EU's policies and values. The event includes workshops, debates, exhibitions, and cultural activities. It's an excellent opportunity for young people to engage directly with EU decision-makers, share their ideas, and learn about the EU's institutions and policies.

   The next EYE is scheduled to take place in May 2023. To participate, you'll need to register online when the registration period opens. Keep an eye on the official EYE website for updates: https://www.europarl.europa.eu/ey2023/en/home

Dear 14-year-old,

It's fantastic to hear about your interest in the European Parliament and its workings! I'm here to help you understand how it functions and how you can engage with it. Here's a breakdown of the European Parliament, its role, and how you can interact with it:

1. **What is the European Parliament?**
   The European Parliament is the legislative branch of the European Union (EU). It's made up of 705 Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) who represent the 27 EU member states. MEPs are elected every five years by EU citizens.

2. **What does the European Parliament do?**
   - **Legislation**: The European Parliament, along with the Council of the EU, has the power to legislate on a wide range of areas, such as trade, environment, and data protection. It can amend, reject, or accept legislative proposals from the European Commission.
   - **Budget**: The Parliament has the power to approve or reject the EU's annual budget.
   - **Supervision**: It supervises the work of the Commission and can force Commissioners to resign through a vote of no confidence.
   - **International agreements**: The Parliament must give its consent to international agreements negotiated by the EU.

3. **How is the European Parliament structured?**
   - **Political groups**: MEPs form political groups based on their political affiliation. There are currently eight political groups in the European Parliament.
   - **Committees**: MEPs sit on committees that deal with specific policy areas, such as the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety or the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
   - **Conference of Presidents**: This is the Parliament's leadership body, composed of the President and the chairs of the political groups.
