Q4b_43_ I am 14 years old and from Malta. I am a little interested in changing society in the area of Economic inequality and welfare expenditure. Can you tell me how I can do this? I am not sure where to start.

I'm glad to hear about your interest in addressing economic inequality and advocating for increased welfare expenditure! Here are some steps you can take to start making a difference, even at your age:

Q5_51_ I am 14 years old and from Malta. I know a little about Citizens’ dialogue, EU Youth Dialogue or EU Youth Conference. Can you tell me more about this? How can I participate?

Citizens’ Dialogues, EU Youth Dialogue, and EU Youth Conferences are all initiatives organised by the European Union (EU) to encourage young people to engage in discussions and debates about various topics related to the EU and its policies. Here’s a brief overview of each and how you can participate:

1. **Citizens’ Dialogues**: These are public events organised by the European Commission and the European Parliament to give citizens the opportunity to discuss EU policies and priorities with high-level EU representatives. Topics can range from the economy and employment to climate change, digitalisation, and more. To participate:
   - Keep an eye on the European Commission’s events page (https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/12086-Events_en) for upcoming Citizens’ Dialogues.
   - Check if there’s an event happening near you or if there’s an online option.
   - Register in advance, as places can be limited.

2. **EU Youth Dialogue**: This is a structured dialogue between young people and EU institutions. It aims to give young people a say in EU policy-making processes that affect them. The EU Youth Dialogue focuses on four main themes: education and employment, participation, health and well-being, and social inclusion. To participate:

Q5_52_ I am 14 years old and from Malta. I know not at all about Public consultations. Can you tell me more about this? I would like to know what they are, how they work and how I can participate in them.

Public consultations are a way for the government, or other organizations, to gather information and opinions from the public before making decisions or implementing new policies. They are an important part of democracy as they allow citizens to have a say in how their country is run.

Here's a simple breakdown of how public consultations work:

1. **Identifying the issue**: The government or organization identifies an issue that needs to be addressed. This could be anything from a new law, to a change in services, to a major infrastructure project.

2. **Consultation document**: They then prepare a document outlining the issue, the proposed solution, and the reasons behind it. This document is made available to the public.

3. **Public engagement**: The public is invited to review the document and provide their feedback. This can be done in various ways, such as:
   - **Online surveys or questionnaires**: These are often the easiest way to participate. You can fill them out at your own pace and from anywhere.
   - **Public meetings or hearings**: These are meetings where you can listen to presentations about the issue and ask questions. Some may also allow for public comment.
   - **Written submissions**: You can submit your feedback in writing, either by mail or email.
   - **Social media**: Some consultations may also engage with the public through social media platforms.

4. **Reviewing feedback**: The government or organization reviews all the feedback they receive. They may use this to refine their proposal, or to understand the public's concerns better.

5. **Decision making**: Finally, the government or organization makes a decision based on their original proposal, the feedback they received, and other factors. They may also publish a summary of the feedback and how it influenced their decision.

As a 14-year-old, you have the right to participate in public consultations. Your voice is important and can help shape
Q5_53_ I am 14 years old and from Malta. I know a little about European elections. Can you tell me more about this? What are they and how do they work?

European elections are a type of election held every five years to elect the members of the European Parliament (EP). The European Parliament is the legislative branch of the European Union (EU), which is a political and economic union of 27 member states that are primarily located in Europe.

Here's a breakdown of how European elections work:

1. **Who can vote and stand as a candidate?**
   - EU citizens who are resident in the member state where they are voting can stand as candidates and vote in the European elections.
   - Non-EU nationals who are long-term residents in an EU country can also vote and stand as candidates in some member states.

2. **How are MEPs elected?**
   - Each member state has a certain number of seats in the European Parliament, allocated based on its population. For example, Germany has the most seats (96), while Malta has the fewest (6).
   - The method of election varies by country. Some use a system of proportional representation, while others use a first-past-the-post system or a mixed system.
   - In some countries, voters can choose a political party, and the seats are allocated to the parties based on their share of the vote. In other countries, voters can choose individual candidates.

3. **What does the European Parliament do?**
   - The European Parliament has several key roles:
     - It legislates: Along with the Council of the EU (which represents the member states), the European Parliament has the power to pass laws that apply across the EU.
     - It approves the EU budget: The Parliament must give its approval for the EU's annual budget.
     - It oversees the Commission: The Parliament has the power to censure the European Commission, the executive branch of the EU, which can lead to the Commission's resignation.

1. **European Commission**: Often referred to as the "guardian of the treaties," the European Commission is the executive body of the EU.

1. **EU-funded programmes**: The EU offers several programmes that allow young people to participate in events and activities. Some of these include:

   - **European Solidarity Corps**: This initiative enables young people to volunteer or work on projects that benefit communities and people across Europe.
   - **Youth Exchange**: This is a short-term mobility project for groups of young people aged 13-30. It aims to bring together young people from different countries to learn about each other's cultures and develop skills.

2. **EU events and conferences**: The EU organises various events and conferences throughout the year, such as the European Youth Event (EYE) in Strasbourg, which brings together thousands of young people to discuss European topics and meet with EU decision-makers. To participate in these events, you can:
   - Keep an eye on the EU's official website and social media channels for announcements about upcoming events.
   - Check if your school or local youth organisation is planning to participate in any EU events and express your interest in joining them.

Q5_59_ I am 14 years old and from Malta. I know not at all about European Citizens’ Initiative. Can you tell me more about this? What is it? How does it work? What are the benefits? What are the drawbacks? What are the chances of success? What are the steps to take if I want to start one?

The European Citizens’ Initiative (ECI) is a unique tool for citizens to participate directly in the democratic life of the European Union (EU). It allows one million or more EU citizens to invite the European Commission to propose a legal act in areas where the Commission has the power to do so. Here’s a breakdown of your questions:

**What is the European Citizens’ Initiative (ECI)?**
The ECI is a democratic tool for EU citizens to propose new legislation. It was introduced in 2012 as part of the Treaty of Lisbon to bring EU citizens closer to the EU institutions and to allow them to participate more directly in the EU’s democratic life.

**How does it work?**
1. **Registration**: A group of citizens from at least seven different EU Member States registers their initiative with the European Commission.
2. **Collection of signatures**: The organisers have one year to collect at least one million signatures from EU citizens who are nationals of at least seven different Member States. Signatures can be collected online or on paper.
3. **Verification**: The Commission verifies the signatures. If the initiative meets the threshold, the Commission has to decide whether to take action or not. If it decides not to, it must explain why.
4. **Follow-up**: If the Commission decides to take action, it can propose a legal act, or explain why it will not do so.

**Benefits of the ECI:**
- It gives EU citizens a direct say in EU policy-making.
- It can raise awareness about important issues and spark debate.
- It can influence EU policy, even if the Commission decides not to take action.

**Drawbacks of the ECI:**
- The threshold of one million signatures is high, making it difficult for initiatives to succeed.
