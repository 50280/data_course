Comment: Welcome to the site. I think you'll find that this is a very broad question, and that there are many different ways to approach it. I would recommend starting with some research on the topic, and then asking more specific questions as you learn more.

You can also start by learning about the history of how we got to where we are now, and what has been tried in the past.

Dear Friend,

It's wonderful to hear about your interest in human rights and your desire to make a difference. At your age, there are many ways you can start to engage with these issues and contribute to positive change. Here are some steps you can take:

1. **Educate Yourself**: Learn about human rights, the issues surrounding them, and the history of the movement. This will give you a solid foundation to build upon. You can start by reading books, watching documentaries, and exploring reliable online resources.

2. **Understand Your Rights**: The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) is a great place to start. It's a document that outlines the basic rights and freedoms that all humans are entitled to. Understanding these rights can help you recognize when they're being violated and inspire you to take action.

3. **Get Involved Locally**: Look for local organizations or initiatives that align with your interests. This could be anything from a school club focused on social justice to a local NGO working on human rights issues. If there aren't any, consider starting your own initiative.

4. **Advocate and Raise Awareness**: You can do this in many ways. Here are a few ideas:
   - **Start a Blog or Vlog**: Share your thoughts, research, and experiences related to human rights.
   - **Organize Events**: This could be a fundraiser, a awareness campaign, or a community discussion.
   - **Write Letters**: Write to local politicians, newspapers, or international organizations to express your views and advocate for change.
   - **Use Social Media**: Platforms like Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook can be powerful tools for raising awareness.

Q5_56_ I am 14 years old and from France. I know not at all about The European Youth Week or the European Youth Event. Can you tell me more about this? Thank you.

The European Youth Week and the European Youth Event are initiatives organized by the European Union to engage young people in the democratic process and to give them a voice in shaping the future of Europe. Here's a brief overview of both events:

1. **European Youth Week (EYW)**: This is an annual event that takes place in early May. It aims to celebrate and promote youth engagement, participation, and active citizenship across Europe. During the EYW, various activities and events are organized by local, regional, and national authorities, as well as by youth organizations and other stakeholders. These events can include workshops, debates, sports activities, cultural events, and more, all centered around the theme of youth and its role in society.

   The EYW provides an opportunity for young people to express their views, share their ideas, and learn about the EU's policies and initiatives that affect them. It also encourages youth organizations and other stakeholders to work together and collaborate on projects that benefit young people.

2. **European Youth Event (EYE)**: The EYE is a biennial event that takes place in the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France. It brings together thousands of young people from all over Europe to discuss and debate on various topics related to the EU's policies and the future of Europe. The event provides a unique opportunity for young people to engage directly with EU decision-makers, including Members of the European Parliament (MEPs), and to have their voices heard.

   The EYE includes a wide range of activities, such as workshops, debates, simulations, and cultural events. Participants can also propose and vote on ideas for the future of Europe through the "Youth Ideas Market" and the "Youth Agenda" initiatives. The outcomes of these discussions and proposals are then presented to the European Parliament and can influence EU policies.

Dear 14-year-old,

It's fantastic that you're taking an interest in the climate crisis and want to reach out to your local representatives. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to contact a Commissioner or a Member of the European Parliament (MEP), along with some tips on what to say:

1. **Find your local representatives:**

   - **Commissioners:** The European Commission has 27 commissioners, each responsible for a specific policy area. You can find them here: <https://ec.europa.eu/commission/president/commissioners_en>

   - **MEPs:** To find your local MEP, you can use the European Parliament's tool: <https://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/search.html?country=FR>

2. **Contact details:** Once you've identified your local representatives, you can find their contact details on their official websites. They usually provide an email address, postal address, and sometimes a phone number or contact form.

3. **Prepare your message:**

   - **Subject line:** Be clear and concise, e.g., "Concerned citizen's inquiry about climate crisis policies."

   - **Introduction:** Start by introducing yourself, mentioning your age and where you're from. You can also explain why you're writing to them.

   - **Body:** Explain what you want to talk about. Here are some points you might want to include:

     a. Mention specific climate issues that concern you, such as deforestation, air pollution, or rising temperatures.

     b. Ask about their stance on the climate crisis and what they're doing to address it.

Dear 14-year-old,

It's wonderful to hear that you're interested in participating in EU events! The European Union (EU) organizes various events and initiatives that are open to young people like you. Here are some ways you can get involved:

1. **EU Youth Dialogue**: This is a platform for young people to express their views and ideas on topics that matter to them. The EU Commission collects these views and uses them to inform policy-making. You can participate by joining local or national discussions, or by contributing online. More information can be found on the European Youth Portal: https://europa.eu/youth/eu-youth-dialogue_en

2. **European Youth Events**: The EU organizes several events throughout the year that bring together young people from across Europe. These include:
   - **European Youth Event (EYE)**: This is a large-scale event held every two years in the European Parliament in Strasbourg. It's an opportunity to meet and discuss ideas with other young people, European decision-makers, and experts. The next EYE is planned for May 2023.
   - **European Youth Weeks**: These are smaller events organized by EU Member States. They focus on specific themes and provide a platform for young people to share their ideas and experiences.

3. **Erasmus+**: This is the EU's program for education, training, youth, and sport. It offers opportunities for young people to study, train, gain work experience, and volunteer abroad. You might not be eligible yet, but it's something to keep in mind as you get older. More information can be found here: https://www.erasmusplus.fr/

4. **Local and National Events**: Many EU Member States also organize their own events and initiatives for young people. These can be a great way to get involved and learn more about the EU. Check with your local or national youth office for more information.
