Q5_51_ I am 14 years old and from Finland. I know not at all about Citizens’ dialogue, EU Youth Dialogue or EU Youth Conference. Can you tell me more about this? I am interested in this topic.

Citizens’ Dialogue, EU Youth Dialogue, and EU Youth Conference are all initiatives organized by the European Union (EU) to encourage young people to engage in democratic processes and have their voices heard on various topics. Here’s a brief overview of each:

1. **Citizens’ Dialogue**: This is a series of public events organized by the European Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen, and other EU institutions. The aim is to engage with citizens across Europe, listen to their concerns, and discuss the future of Europe. These dialogues are open to everyone, regardless of age, and provide an opportunity to ask questions and share ideas directly with EU leaders. While not exclusively for youth, they are a great way for young people to engage with EU politics.

2. **EU Youth Dialogue**: This is a structured dialogue process between young people and EU institutions. It aims to give young people a say in matters that affect them and to ensure that their ideas and concerns are taken into account in EU policy-making. The dialogue focuses on four main themes: education and employment; participation; health and well-being; and environmental sustainability. The EU Youth Dialogue is organized by the European Commission, in cooperation with national authorities and youth organizations.

   - **EU Youth Conference**: This is the annual event that brings together young people from all EU Member States to discuss and vote on the priorities for the EU Youth Dialogue. It’s a great opportunity for young people to meet, exchange ideas, and have a direct impact on EU youth policy. To participate, you would need to be nominated by your national authority or a recognized youth organization in your country.

To get involved, you can:

- Keep an eye on the European Commission’s website for announcements about Citizens’ Dialogues and EU Youth Dialogue events.
- Check if there are any youth organizations or local initiatives in Finland that are involved in EU youth policy.
- Follow the EU Youth Dialogue on social

Q5_53_ I am 14 years old and from Finland. I know kind of about European elections. Can you tell me more about this? I am interested in politics and I want to know more about it.

The European Parliament elections are held every five years to elect the members of the European Parliament (EP). The EP is the legislative branch of the European Union (EU), and it has the power to pass laws and approve the EU budget. Here are some key points about the European elections:

1. **Who can vote and run for election?**
   - EU citizens who are resident in an EU country can vote and run for election in the European elections.

2. **How are the MEPs elected?**
   - The number of MEPs each country has is based on its population. Finland has 13 MEPs.

   - The number of MEPs each party gets is proportional to the number of votes they receive.

3. **What do the MEPs do?**
   - MEPs work in parliamentary committees and political groups to scrutinize and amend legislation proposed by the European Commission.
   - They also have the power to approve or reject the EU budget and can censure the European Commission, leading to its resignation.
   - MEPs represent the interests of their constituents and the EU as a whole in the legislative process.

4. **When are the next European elections?**
   - The next European elections are scheduled to take place in May 2024.

Q5_57_ I am 14 years old and from Finland. I know not at all about Contacting a Commissioner or an MEP. Can you tell me more about this? I have a question about the EU and I want to ask it to the EU. I have tried to find out how to do this but I have not found any information. Can you help me?

Dear friend,

I'm glad to hear that you're interested in engaging with the European Union (EU) and its institutions. Here's a step-by-step guide on how you can contact a Commissioner or a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) to ask your question about the EU:

1. **European Commissioners:**
   - The European Commission is the executive branch of the EU, responsible for proposing and enforcing legislation. Each Commissioner is responsible for a specific policy area.
   - To find the right Commissioner for your question, visit the European Commission's website: <https://ec.europa.eu/commission/offices/index_en>
   - Click on the Commissioner's name or portfolio that matches your topic of interest. You'll find their contact details, including email address and postal address, on their profile page.
   - When writing to a Commissioner, be clear, concise, and polite. Explain your question or concern, and provide any relevant context or background information.

2. **Members of the European Parliament (MEPs):**
   - The European Parliament is the legislative branch of the EU, responsible for passing laws and overseeing the other EU institutions.
   - To find your MEP, visit the European Parliament's website: <https://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/map.html>
   - Click on your country on the map, and you'll be directed to a list of your MEPs. Click on the name of the MEP you'd like to contact, and you'll find their contact details, including email address and postal address.
   - When writing to an MEP, follow the same guidelines as when writing to a Commissioner. Additionally, you can ask your MEP to raise your question or concern in the European Parliament.

I am 14 years old and from Finland. I'm interested in learning more about events organized by the EU in my country and how I can participate in them. Could you provide some information on this topic?

The European Union (EU) organizes various events and initiatives across its member states, including Finland, to engage citizens, especially young people, in the democratic process and to promote European integration. Here are some ways you can participate in EU-related events and initiatives in Finland:

1. **EU Open House Day**: This event is held annually in May, and it offers an opportunity to visit EU institutions and agencies in Finland, such as the European Commission Representation in Finland and the European Parliament Information Office in Finland. You can learn about the EU's work and ask questions directly to EU officials. To participate, keep an eye on the EU Delegation to Finland's website for updates and registration details.

2. **EU Youth Dialogue**: The EU Youth Dialogue is a platform for young people to express their views and ideas on topics that matter to them. It aims to involve young people in EU policy-making processes. In Finland, the National Youth Council of Finland (Allianssi) coordinates the EU Youth Dialogue. You can participate by joining local discussions and events organized by Allianssi or by submitting your ideas online.

Q5_59_ I am 14 years old and from Finland. I know a little about European Citizens’ Initiative. Can you tell me more about this? What is it and how does it work?

The European Citizens’ Initiative (ECI) is a unique tool for EU citizens to participate directly in the EU’s democratic life. It was introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon in 2009 and has been in operation since 2012. Here’s a simple breakdown of how it works:

1. **Who can propose an initiative?**
   - At least 7 EU citizens from at least 7 different Member States can propose an initiative.
   - They must form a citizens’ committee of between 7 and 700 people, with at least one citizen from each of the 7 Member States.

2. **What can be proposed?**
   - The initiative must relate to an area where the EU has competence to legislate (e.g., environment, energy, transport, etc.).
   - It must be clearly formulated and indicate the desired legal act (e.g., a directive, regulation, or decision).

3. **Gathering signatures:**
   - Once the initiative is registered, the citizens’ committee has one year to gather at least 1 million signatures from EU citizens.
   - Signatures must come from at least 7 different Member States, and the number of signatures from each Member State must be proportional to its population.

4. **What happens after the signatures are collected?**
   - If the initiative gathers at least 1 million signatures within one year, the European Commission will examine it and decide whether to propose legislation on the basis of the initiative.
   - The Commission is not obliged to take action, but it must explain its decision to the European Parliament and the Council.

5. **Follow-up:**
   - If the Commission decides not to take action, the European Parliament can debate the initiative and may invite the Commission to submit a proposal.
   - The Parliament can also organize a public hearing on the initiative.
