   - **Join online forums or social media groups:** There are many online platforms where people discuss politics and current events. Participating in these discussions can help you learn and engage with others.

Thank you for your question. It's great to hear that you're interested in getting involved in democratic activities in your local community. Here are some ways you can participate:

1. **Join a Youth Council or Youth Parliament**: Many local governments have youth councils or youth parliaments where young people can have a say in local decisions. These groups often discuss and vote on issues that affect young people and the wider community. Check if your local municipality has one and how you can join.

4. **Join a School Council or Student Council**: If your school doesn't have one, you could start a student council. This gives you a chance to voice your opinions about school-related issues and learn about leadership and decision-making.

5. **Participate in Surveys and Consultations**: Local governments often conduct surveys or consultations to gather public opinion on various issues. These are great opportunities for you to have your say.

6. **Join a Political Party or Youth Wing**: If you're interested in politics, you might want to join a political party or its youth wing. This can give you a chance to learn about political processes and influence policy.

7. **Start a Community Project**: If you see a need in your community, you could start a project to address it. This could be anything from a community garden to a recycling initiative or a community event.

Q5_51_ I am 14 years old and from Denmark. I know a lot about Citizens’ dialogue, EU Youth Dialogue or EU Youth Conference. Can you tell me more about this? I would like to know more about the EU Youth Dialogue and how I can participate in it.

The EU Youth Dialogue is a platform for young people to express their views and ideas on topics that are important to them. It is a way for young people to have a say in the development of EU policies that affect them. The dialogue is organized by the European Commission and is open to young people aged 13-30 from all EU Member States.

The EU Youth Dialogue is structured around four main themes:

1. Education and employment
2. Participation and democracy
3. Environment and sustainability
4. Health and well-being

Each year, the European Commission selects one of these themes as the focus for the EU Youth Dialogue. Young people are then invited to participate in national and European events to discuss and share their ideas on the chosen theme.

To participate in the EU Youth Dialogue, you can:

1. Join a national event: Each EU Member State organizes national events to gather the views of young people. You can find out more about these events and how to participate by contacting your national youth council or the European Commission's representation in your country.
2. Join an online discussion: The European Commission also organizes online discussions on the EU Youth Dialogue website. You can join these discussions and share your ideas with other young people from across Europe.
3. Join a European event: Each year, the European Commission organizes a European Youth Event (EYE) in Strasbourg, France. This is a large-scale event that brings together thousands of young people from across Europe to discuss and debate the future of Europe. You can apply to participate in the EYE through the European Commission's website.

By participating in the EU Youth Dialogue, you can help to shape EU policies that affect young people and have a say in the future of Europe. It's a great opportunity to meet other young people from across Europe and to develop your skills and knowledge.
Q5_52_ I am 14 years old and from Denmark. I know not at all about Public consultations. Can you tell me more about this? I am interested in the topic of climate change and I want to know how I can participate in the public consultations about climate change.

Public consultations are a way for governments, organizations, and other stakeholders to gather input and feedback from the public on various issues, including climate change. Here's a step-by-step guide on how you can participate in public consultations related to climate change:

1. **Find relevant consultations:**
   - **Government consultations:** Check your country's government websites for ongoing consultations. For example, in Denmark, you can look at the websites of the Ministry of Climate, Energy and Utilities or the Ministry of Environment.
   - **International organizations:** The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and other international bodies often have public consultations. You can sign up for their newsletters or follow their websites for updates.
   - **Local consultations:** Your city or municipality might also have consultations on local climate action plans. Check their websites for more information.
   - **Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and think tanks:** Some NGOs and think tanks conduct their own consultations or surveys. Keep an eye on their websites and social media channels for opportunities.

2. **Understand the topic:** Before participating, make sure you understand the topic of the consultation. Read the consultation document or background information provided to familiarize yourself with the issue at hand.

3. **Prepare your input:** Think about what you want to say and how you can best express your views. You can provide personal experiences, suggest solutions, or share your concerns. Remember that your input should be relevant to the topic and respectful.

4. **Submit your response:** Follow the instructions provided to submit your response. This could be through an online form, email, or post. Make sure to submit your response before the deadline.

5. **Spread the word:** Encourage your friends, family, and peers to participate in the consultation as well. The more voices that are heard, the better.

Q5_58_ I am 14 years old and from Denmark. I know  about Participation in events organised by the EU in your country. Can you tell me more about this? I am interested in participating in events organised by the EU in my country.

Participating in events organised by the EU in your country can be a great way to learn more about the European Union, its policies, and its impact on your daily life. Here are some ways you can get involved:

1. **EU Information Days and Events**: The European Commission and other EU institutions often organise information days, conferences, and workshops in member states to engage with citizens and discuss various topics. These events can cover a wide range of subjects, from climate change and digital transformation to youth unemployment and education.

Q5_59_ I am 14 years old and from Denmark. I know kind of about European Citizens’ Initiative. Can you tell me more about this? What is it and how does it work?

A European Citizens’ Initiative (ECI) is a unique tool for EU citizens to participate directly in the EU’s democratic life. It allows one million or more EU citizens to invite the European Commission to propose a legal act in areas where the Commission has the power to do so. Here’s a simple breakdown of how it works:

1. **Initiation**: Any EU citizen, or a group of citizens, can initiate an ECI. They need to collect the support of at least one million EU citizens from at least seven different Member States within one year.

2. **Registration**: The initiators register their ECI with the European Commission. The Commission checks if the ECI is admissible, meaning it falls within the Commission's competence and respects the Treaties.

3. **Collection of Support**: If the ECI is admissible, the initiators can start collecting signatures. Each EU country has a national threshold for signatures, which is proportional to the size of its population. For example, in Denmark, the threshold is around 45,000 signatures.

4. **Verification**: Once the one million signatures are collected, the Commission verifies them. If the ECI reaches the threshold in at least seven Member States, the Commission has to examine it and decide whether to propose a legal act on the basis of the ECI.

5. **Follow-up**: If the Commission decides not to follow up on the ECI, it has to explain its reasons to the European Parliament and the Council. The initiators can also ask the European Parliament to consider their initiative.

The ECI was introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon in 2009 to give EU citizens a direct say in EU policy-making. It's a way to bring EU citizens closer to the EU institutions and to make the EU more democratic. However, it's important to note that the Commission is not obliged to follow up on an ECI, but it
