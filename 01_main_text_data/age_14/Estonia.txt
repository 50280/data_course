Q4b_46_ I am 14 years old and from Estonia. I am not at all interested in changing society in the area of Wars and conflicts. Can you tell me how I can do this? I want to be a peacekeeper in the future. What should I do?

It's wonderful to hear about your interest in peacekeeping and your desire to make a positive impact on the world. Here are some steps you can take to work towards your goal:

1. **Education**: Start by learning about peacekeeping, conflict resolution, and international relations. Read books, watch documentaries, and follow news about peacekeeping missions and organizations. Some recommended books include "Peacekeeping in International Relations" by Michael P. Colaresi, "The Blue Helmets: A Review of United Nations Peacekeeping" by Michael P. Schroeder, and "Peacekeeping: From Billion-Dollar Bungles to Bargain Basement Bargains" by Michael P. Schroeder.

If there aren't any, consider starting one. This can help you connect with like-minded individuals and gain practical experience.

3. **Volunteer**: Look for local volunteering opportunities that align with your interests. This could be anything from helping at a local community center to volunteering with an international NGO. This will not only give you valuable experience but also help you build a network of contacts.

4. **Learn a Second Language**: Knowing a second language can be very beneficial in peacekeeping roles. Consider learning a language that is commonly spoken in regions where peacekeeping missions are often deployed.

Q5_51_ I am 14 years old and from Estonia. I know not at all about Citizens’ dialogue, EU Youth Dialogue or EU Youth Conference. Can you tell me more about this? I am interested in this topic.

Citizens’ Dialogue, EU Youth Dialogue, and EU Youth Conference are all initiatives organized by the European Union (EU) to encourage young people to engage in democratic processes and have their voices heard on various topics. Here’s a brief overview of each:

1. **Citizens’ Dialogue**: This is a series of public events organized by the European Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen, and other EU institutions. The aim is to bring together EU citizens and policymakers to discuss EU policies and priorities. These dialogues provide a platform for citizens to share their views and concerns, and for policymakers to understand the needs and expectations of EU citizens. Topics can range from the EU's long-term budget and recovery plan to climate change, digital transformation, and more.

2. **EU Youth Dialogue**: This is a structured dialogue between young people and EU decision-makers. It aims to give young people a say in matters that affect them and to ensure that their ideas and concerns are taken into account in EU policy-making. The EU Youth Dialogue focuses on four main themes: education and employment; participation; health and well-being; and social inclusion. It involves a series of events at local, national, and EU levels, culminating in an annual EU Youth Conference.

3. **EU Youth Conference**: This is the annual flagship event of the EU Youth Dialogue. It brings together around 100 young people from across the EU to discuss and vote on policy recommendations related to the four main themes of the EU Youth Dialogue. The results of the conference are then presented to EU decision-makers, who are encouraged to take them into account when developing and implementing EU policies.

As a 14-year-old from Estonia, you might not be able to participate directly in these events yet, as they are typically open to young people aged 16-30. However, you can still get involved in the following ways:

Q5_59_ I am 14 years old and from Estonia. I know not at all about European Citizens’ Initiative. Can you tell me more about this? What is it? How can I participate? What are the benefits of it?

The European Citizens’ Initiative (ECI) is a unique tool for EU citizens to participate directly in the EU’s democratic life. It allows you to call on the European Commission to propose new legislation in areas where the Commission has the power to do so. Here’s a simple breakdown:

1. **What is it?**
   The ECI is a way for EU citizens to influence EU policy-making. It was introduced in 2012 as part of the Treaty of Lisbon to bring EU citizens closer to the EU institutions and to allow them to participate more directly in the political process.

2. **How does it work?**
   - **Initiating an ECI**: Any EU citizen, or a group of citizens, can initiate an ECI by submitting a proposal to the European Commission. The proposal must be supported by at least one million EU citizens from at least seven different Member States.
   - **Collecting signatures**: Once the proposal is registered, the organisers have one year to collect signatures. Signatures can be collected online or on paper. Each signatory must be an EU citizen and must sign only once.
   - **Assessment by the Commission**: If the ECI collects at least one million signatures, the European Commission will examine the proposal and decide whether to act on it. If the Commission decides not to act, it must explain its reasons to the European Parliament and the Council.

3. **How can you participate?**
   - **Support an ECI**: You can support an ongoing ECI by signing it. You can find a list of ongoing ECIs on the European Commission's website.
   - **Initiate an ECI**: If you're over 18 and have the support of at least seven other EU citizens from different Member States, you can initiate your own ECI. You'll need to submit a proposal to the European Commission following their guidelines
