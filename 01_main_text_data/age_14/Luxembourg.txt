Q3_30_ I am 14 years old and from Luxembourg. I have never taken part in activities that relate to democratic participation because I don’t understand the issues enough. For my friends, this is not at all the same. Can you tell me more about how I can do that? Thank you.

Dear Luxembourgish teenager,

It's great to hear that you're interested in getting involved in democratic participation! Here are some ways you can start, even at your age:

1. **Educate Yourself**: The first step is to learn about the issues that matter to you. This could be anything from climate change, to education policies, to local community issues. Websites, books, and documentaries can be great resources. In Luxembourg, you can check out websites like https://www.luxtimes.lu/ or https://www.wort.lu/ for local news.

2. **Join a Club or Group**: There might be clubs or groups at your school or in your community that focus on issues you care about. Joining these can help you meet like-minded people and learn more. For example, there might be environmental clubs, social justice groups, or even political parties that welcome young members.

3. **Volunteer**: Volunteering is a great way to get involved in your community. It could be anything from helping at a local charity, to participating in community clean-up events, to volunteering at a local political campaign.

4. **Attend Local Meetings**: Many local governments have meetings that are open to the public. Attending these can give you a firsthand look at how decisions are made. In Luxembourg, you can check the websites of your local commune for meeting schedules.

5. **Write to Your Representatives**: You can write letters or emails to your local representatives to express your views on issues. They represent you, so they should be interested in hearing from you.

6. **Participate in Youth-Led Initiatives**: There are many youth-led initiatives that focus on democratic participation. For example, the European Youth Parliament (EYP) is a great way to learn about European politics and practice public speaking and debate.

7. **Vote**: Once you're old enough, make sure to register to vote and cast your ballot.
Q3_31_ I am 14 years old and from Luxembourg. I have never taken part in activities that relate to democratic participation because Nobody has ever asked or invited me to take part. For my friends, this is a little the same. Can you tell me more about how I can do that? Thank you.

Dear Luxembourgish teenager,

It's great to hear that you're interested in democratic participation! Here are some ways you can get involved, both locally and internationally:

1. **Local Youth Council (Conseil des Jeunes)**: Luxembourg has local youth councils in many municipalities. These councils give young people a voice in local decision-making processes. You can find more information about your local youth council on the website of your municipality or the national platform for youth councils: <https://www.conseildesjeunes.lu/>

2. **National Youth Council (Ligue des Jeunes)**: The Ligue des Jeunes is the national youth council of Luxembourg. They represent the interests of young people at the national level and organize various activities and projects. You can find more information on their website: <https://www.ligue.lu/>

3. **Youth Parliament (Parlement des Jeunes)**: The Youth Parliament is a simulation of the Luxembourgish parliament where young people can learn about democracy and politics. They organize elections and sessions where young people can debate and vote on bills. More information can be found here: <https://www.parlementdesjeunes.lu/>

4. **Youth Initiatives**: You can also start your own initiative or project. This could be anything from organizing a local event, starting a petition, or creating a club at your school. The Ligue des Jeunes and the Conseil des Jeunes can provide support and guidance for these kinds of projects.

5. **International Organizations**: There are also international organizations that focus on youth participation.

Q3_32_ I am 14 years old and from Luxembourg. I have never taken part in activities that relate to democratic participation because I did not know that I could do this. For my friends, this is not at all the same. Can you tell me more about how I can do that? Thank you.

Dear Luxembourgish teenager,

It's great to hear that you're interested in democratic participation! Here are some ways you can get involved, even at your age:

1. **Youth Parliament**: Luxembourg has a Youth Parliament (Jeugdparlament) where young people aged 16 to 21 can participate in political debates and decision-making processes. Although you're a bit young for this, it's a great initiative to keep in mind for the future. You can still follow their activities and engage with them on social media.

2. **School Council**: If your school doesn't already have one, you could propose the creation of a school council. This would give you and your peers a say in how your school is run. You could discuss issues like school rules, activities, and improvements to the school environment.

3. **Local Youth Council**: Some municipalities in Luxembourg have youth councils (Conseil communal de la jeunesse). These allow young people to express their views on local issues and participate in decision-making processes that affect them. Check if your municipality has one and how you can get involved.

4. **Volunteering**: While not directly political, volunteering can help you understand the needs of your community and give you a chance to make a difference. You could volunteer with local charities, sports clubs, or cultural organizations.

5. **Online Petitions and Campaigns**: Websites like Avaaz and Change.org allow you to sign petitions on a wide range of issues. You can also start your own petition if you have an issue you're passionate about.

6. **Social Media**: Follow local politicians, political parties, and news outlets on social media. Engage with their posts by liking, sharing, and commenting. This can help you stay informed and express your opinions.

7. **Educate Yourself**: Learn about the political system in Luxembourg, the different political parties, and the issues they stand for. This will help you make informed

   - The European Youth Dialogue: https://ec.europa.eu/youth/participation/youth-dialogue_en
   - The Luxembourgish Youth Council's online platforms: https://www.jugendrat.lu/

3. **School Activities**: Many schools offer programs or clubs that focus on democracy, politics, or social issues. Joining these can be a great way to learn more and get involved.

Q5_53_ I am 14 years old and from Luxembourg. I know not at all about European elections. Can you tell me more about this? What are they? When are they? And why are they important?

Thank you for your question. European elections are a type of election held every five years to elect the members of the European Parliament (EP), which is the legislative branch of the European Union (EU). The EP is responsible for legislating on a wide range of policy areas, including trade, agriculture, fisheries, and environmental protection, among others.

The next European elections are scheduled to take place in May 2024. However, the exact dates may vary depending on the country. In Luxembourg, for example, the elections are typically held on a Sunday in early June.

European elections are important for several reasons. Firstly, they provide an opportunity for EU citizens to have a direct say in the composition of the EP and, by extension, the direction of EU policy. Secondly, the EP plays a crucial role in the EU's decision-making process, as it has the power to amend and adopt legislation, as well as to scrutinize and approve the EU's budget. Thirdly, the EP has the power to censure the European Commission, the EU's executive branch, and force it to resign. Finally, European elections are an important opportunity for EU citizens to engage with the democratic process and express their views on the future of the EU.

In Luxembourg, European elections are conducted using a proportional representation system, with voters casting their ballots for political parties rather than individual candidates. The number of seats allocated to each party is determined by the proportion of votes it receives. Luxembourg is allocated six seats in the EP, which is the smallest number of any EU member state.

In conclusion, European elections are an important democratic process that allows EU citizens to have a say in the direction of EU policy and the composition of the EP. They are held every five years, with the next elections scheduled for May 2024. In Luxembourg, the elections are typically held in early June using a proportional representation system.

The European Youth Event (EYE) is an annual event organized by the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France.

Q5_57_ I am 14 years old and from Luxembourg. I know not at all about Contacting a Commissioner or an MEP. Can you tell me more about this? I would like to contact them about the climate crisis.

I am very happy to help you with this! Here's a step-by-step guide on how to contact a European Commissioner or a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) about the climate crisis:

1. **Find the relevant Commissioner:**
   The European Commission is the executive branch of the EU, and it's responsible for proposing and enforcing legislation. The Commissioner for Climate Action and Energy is the most relevant for your topic. The current Commissioner is Frans Timmermans. You can find his contact details here: https://ec.europa.eu/commission/commissioners/2019-2024/timmermans_en

   You can also find other Commissioners and their contact details here: https://ec.europa.eu/commission/index_en

2. **Find your MEPs:**
   MEPs are directly elected by EU citizens and represent them in the European Parliament. To find your MEPs, you can use the "Find your MEP" tool on the European Parliament's website: https://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/search

   Once you've found your MEPs, you can contact them using the contact details provided on their profile pages.

3. **Prepare your message:**
   - Be clear and concise. Explain who you are, where you're from, and why you're writing.
   - Explain the issue you're concerned about (in this case, the climate crisis) and why it's important to you.
   - Make specific, actionable requests. For example, you might ask them to support a specific piece of legislation, or to raise awareness about an issue.
   - Be polite and respectful.

4. **Write your message:**
   You can write your message in your own language, but keep in mind that English is widely spoken and understood among Commissioners and MEPs. Here's a sample message to help you get started:
