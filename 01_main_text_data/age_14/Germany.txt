Q3_30_ I am 14 years old and from Germany. I have never taken part in activities that relate to democratic participation because I don’t understand the issues enough. For my friends, this is  the same. Can you tell me more about how I can do that? I would like to be more involved in the democratic process.

Thank you for your question. It’s great to hear that you’re interested in getting more involved in the democratic process! Here are some ways you can start:

1. **Educate Yourself**: The first step is to learn about the issues that matter to you. This could be anything from climate change, to education, to social justice. Read articles, watch documentaries, and talk to people to gain a better understanding of these topics.

2. **Join a Club or Group**: There might be clubs or groups at your school or in your community that focus on issues you care about. Joining these can help you connect with like-minded people and learn more about how to take action.

3. **Attend Local Meetings**: Many local governments have meetings that are open to the public. Attending these can give you a firsthand look at how decisions are made and how you can have a say in them.

4. **Write to Your Representatives**: Once you understand the issues, you can write to your local, regional, or national representatives to express your views. They represent you, so it's important for them to know what you think.

5. **Participate in Protests or Demonstrations**: If there are issues you feel strongly about, consider participating in protests or demonstrations. This can be a powerful way to show that you care about an issue and want to see change.

6. **Vote**: When you're old enough, make sure to register to vote and cast your ballot. Your vote is your voice, and it's important to use it.

7. **Start a Petition**: If there's an issue you care about that's not being addressed, you could start a petition. This can help raise awareness and show others that you're not alone in your concerns.

8. **Volunteer**: Volunteering for a cause you believe in can be a great way to get involved and make a difference

Q3_33_ I am 14 years old and from Germany. I have never taken part in activities that relate to democratic participation because These activities are too far away.

I would like to participate in democratic activities.

Dear 14-year-old,

It's great to hear that you're interested in participating in democratic activities! There are several ways you can get involved, even if you're not able to physically attend events due to distance or transportation issues. Here are some suggestions:

1. **Online Petitions and Campaigns**: Websites like Change.org, Avaaz, and 38 Degrees allow you to sign petitions and participate in campaigns on various issues. You can also start your own petition on some of these platforms.

2. **Social Media**: Platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram can be used to raise awareness about issues you care about. You can join groups, follow relevant hashtags, and engage with others who share your interests.

3. **Write to Your Representatives**: You can write letters or emails to your local, regional, or national representatives to express your views on various issues. Many politicians have email addresses or online contact forms on their official websites.

4. **Youth Organizations and Clubs**: Look for local youth organizations or clubs that focus on democracy, politics, or social issues. They might have online activities or resources that you can participate in.

5. **Online Debates and Forums**: Websites like Reddit have subreddits dedicated to politics and social issues where you can participate in discussions. There are also online forums and debate platforms where you can engage with others.

6. **Volunteer**: If there are local organizations or charities working on issues you care about, you might be able to volunteer your time, even if it's just a few hours a week. This can be a great way to learn more about the issues and make a difference.

7. **Educate Yourself**: The more you know about the issues, the better equipped you'll be to participate in democratic activities. There are many online resources, including news websites, documentaries, and educational videos, that can help

Q5_51_ I am 14 years old and from Germany. I know not at all about Citizens’ dialogue, EU Youth Dialogue or EU Youth Conference. Can you tell me more about this? I am interested in the topic of climate change and would like to participate in the EU Youth Dialogue.

The EU Youth Dialogue is a platform for young people to engage with policymakers and express their views on issues that affect them. It is a key element of the EU Youth Strategy, which aims to empower young people and give them a voice in EU policy-making processes.

The EU Youth Dialogue is organized by the European Commission, in cooperation with national authorities and youth organizations. It brings together young people from all over Europe to discuss and debate on a wide range of topics, including climate change, education, employment, and digitalization.

The dialogue takes place at different levels:

* At the local and regional level, through national structures and youth organizations.
* At the national level, through national youth councils and other youth structures.
* At the European level, through the EU Youth Conference and the EU Youth Dialogue events.

The EU Youth Conference is the main event of the EU Youth Dialogue. It brings together around 100 young people from all over Europe to discuss and debate on a specific topic and to make recommendations to policymakers. The next EU Youth Conference will take place in 2023 and will focus on the topic of climate change.

To participate in the EU Youth Dialogue, you can:

* Join a local or national youth organization that is involved in the EU Youth Dialogue.
* Follow the calls for participants for the EU Youth Conference and other EU Youth Dialogue events.
* Engage with policymakers and decision-makers in your country and at the European level to express your views on the topics that matter to you.

As a 14-year-old, you may not be able to participate directly in the EU Youth Conference, as it is open to young people aged 18-30. However, you can still get involved in the EU Youth Dialogue by joining a youth organization or engaging with policymakers in your country.

Q5_53_ I am 14 years old and from Germany. I know kind of about European elections. Can you tell me more about this? I am interested in politics and I want to know more about the European Union.

The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of 27 member states that are primarily located in Europe. It has developed an internal single market through a standardized system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital, and to enhance political, economic, and social cooperation.

The European Parliament is the legislative branch of the EU, and it is directly elected by EU citizens every five years. The next European Parliament elections are scheduled to take place in May 2024. Here are some key points about the European elections:

1. **Who can vote?** EU citizens who are resident in a member state other than their own can vote in the European elections in their country of residence. For example, a German citizen living in France can vote in the French European elections. Additionally, some non-EU nationals who are long-term residents in an EU country may also be eligible to vote.
2. **Who can run?** European political parties and national political parties can put forward candidates for the European elections. These candidates are often part of transnational lists, which allow voters to choose a political party rather than just a national candidate.
3. **How are seats allocated?** The number of seats in the European Parliament is allocated to each member state based on its population. The largest countries, such as Germany and France, have the most seats, while smaller countries have fewer.
4. **What does the European Parliament do?** The European Parliament has several key roles:
	* It legislates alongside the Council of the EU (representing the member states) to create EU laws.
	* It approves or rejects the European Commission, the executive branch of the EU.
	* It monitors the activities of the Commission and can censure it.
	* It approves the EU's budget.
	* It has the power to

Q5_59_ I am 14 years old and from Germany. I know a little about European Citizens’ Initiative. Can you tell me more about this? What is it and how does it work?

The European Citizens’ Initiative (ECI) is a unique tool for EU citizens to participate directly in the EU’s democratic life. It was introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon in 2009 and has been in operation since 2012. Here’s a simple breakdown of how it works:

1. **Who can propose an initiative?**
   - At least 7 EU citizens from at least 7 different Member States can propose an initiative.
   - They must form a citizens’ committee of between 7 and 700 people, with at least one citizen from each of the 7 Member States.

2. **What can be proposed?**
   - The initiative must relate to an area where the EU has competence to legislate (e.g., environment, energy, transport, etc.).
   - It must be clearly formulated and indicate the desired legal act (e.g., a directive, regulation, or decision).

3. **Gathering signatures:**
   - Once the initiative is registered, the citizens’ committee has one year to gather at least 1 million signatures from EU citizens.
   - Signatures must come from at least 7 different Member States, with a minimum number of signatures per Member State (this varies depending on the size of the country’s population).

4. **What happens after the signatures are gathered?**
   - If the initiative gathers enough signatures, the European Commission will examine it and decide whether to propose legislation on the basis of the initiative.
   - The Commission is not obliged to take action, but it must explain its decision to the European Parliament and the Council.

5. **Transparency and feedback:**
   - Throughout the process, there are opportunities for feedback and dialogue. The European Commission provides regular updates on the progress of the initiative, and the citizens’ committee can engage with the Commission and other EU institutions.

Here are a few examples of successful ECIs:
