Q3_30_ I am 14 years old and from Poland. I have never taken part in activities that relate to democratic participation because I don’t understand the issues enough. For my friends, this is a lot the same. Can you tell me more about how I can do that? I would like to be more involved in my community.

Thank you for your question. It’s great to hear that you’re interested in getting more involved in your community and in democratic participation. Here are some steps you can take to start:

1. **Educate Yourself**: The first step is to learn about the issues that affect your community. This could be anything from local politics, environmental issues, social causes, or even school-related matters. You can start by reading local news, watching videos, or talking to people around you.

2. **Join Clubs or Groups**: Look for clubs or groups that align with your interests. These could be school clubs, local youth groups, or online communities. Being part of these groups can help you connect with like-minded individuals and learn more about the issues you care about.

3. **Volunteer**: Volunteering is a great way to get involved in your community. It could be helping out at a local charity, participating in community clean-up events, or assisting with local political campaigns. This not only helps you understand the issues better but also allows you to make a difference.

4. **Attend Local Meetings**: Many communities have regular meetings where local issues are discussed. These could be school council meetings, town hall meetings, or meetings of local community groups. Attending these meetings can give you a firsthand understanding of how decisions are made and how you can contribute.

5. **Start Your Own Initiative**: If you don’t see any existing groups or initiatives that align with your interests, consider starting your own. This could be a school club, a community project, or even a local protest. Remember, you’re never too young to make a difference.

6. **Use Your Voice**: Don’t hesitate to share your opinions and ideas. This could be through writing letters to local officials, speaking at meetings, or using social media to raise awareness about issues you care about.

Thank you for your question. It's great to hear that you're interested in getting involved in democratic participation. Here are some ways you can do that, even at your age:

1. **Youth Councils or Youth Parliaments**: Many cities and countries have youth councils or youth parliaments where young people can voice their opinions and influence local decision-making. These are often open to young people aged 11-18. Check if there's one in your area.

2. **School Council or Student Council**: If your school doesn't have one, you could start a student council. This is a great way to learn about democracy and make changes in your school.

3. **Volunteer**: Volunteering for local charities or community groups can give you a sense of how your community works and how you can contribute to it.

4. **Join a Club or Group**: Joining a club or group that aligns with your interests can help you understand different perspectives and learn about advocacy.

5. **Attend Local Meetings**: Many local governments have meetings that are open to the public. Attending these can give you a sense of how local decisions are made.

6. **Educate Yourself**: Learn about the political system in your country. Understanding how it works can help you figure out how to participate.

7. **Talk to Others**: Discuss your interests and concerns with friends, family, and other adults. They might have insights or suggestions.

Q3_33_ I am 14 years old and from Poland. I have never taken part in activities that relate to democratic participation because These activities are too far away. It is difficult to get there from my home  (e.g. by public transport). For my friends, this is kind of the same. Can you tell me more about how I can do that? I would like to participate in activities that relate to democratic participation.

Dear friend,

It's great to hear that you're interested in democratic participation! Even though it might seem challenging to get involved due to geographical constraints, there are still many ways you can engage in democratic processes. Here are some suggestions:

1. **Online Platforms**: Many organizations and governments now offer online platforms for civic engagement. You can participate in online forums, sign petitions, or even vote in some cases. Some examples include:
   - Avaaz (www.avaaz.org): An online campaigning platform that allows you to sign petitions and participate in online actions.
   - Change.org (www.change.org): A platform where you can start or sign petitions on various issues.
   - Your local government's website: Many local governments have online platforms where you can voice your opinions and participate in decision-making processes.

2. **Youth Organizations**: Join or start a youth organization in your local community. This can be a great way to connect with like-minded individuals and work together on local issues. You can also reach out to existing youth organizations in your area to see if they have any opportunities for you to get involved.

3. **School Activities**: Your school might have clubs or groups that focus on social issues, human rights, or environmental concerns. Joining these groups can be a great way to learn about democratic participation and make a difference in your community.

4. **Volunteering**: Volunteering for local non-profit organizations can also be a form of democratic participation. You can help these organizations advocate for issues you care about and make a difference in your community.

5. **Social Media**: Use social media platforms to raise awareness about issues you care about. You can share news articles, start discussions, or even create a blog to express your opinions.

6. **Write to Your Representatives**: You can write letters or emails to your local, regional, or national representatives to express your opinions on various issues

Q5_53_ I am 14 years old and from Poland. I know kind of about European elections. Can you tell me more about this? I am interested in politics.

The European Parliament elections, also known as the European elections, are a set of elections held every five years to elect the members of the European Parliament (EP). The EP is the legislative branch of the European Union (EU), and it plays a crucial role in EU decision-making processes. Here are some key aspects of the European elections:

1. **Who can vote and run for office?**
   - EU citizens: Any EU citizen who is at least 18 years old (or the minimum voting age in their country, if lower) can vote and run for office in the European elections. They can choose to vote in their home country or in another EU member state where they reside.
   - Non-EU citizens: Some EU countries also allow long-term resident non-EU citizens to vote and run for office in European elections. However, this is not a universal right and depends on the specific rules of each member state.

2. **How are MEPs elected?**
   - The elections use a system of proportional representation, meaning that seats are allocated to political parties based on their share of the vote. The exact method varies by country, with some using closed lists and others using open lists or a mixed system.
   - Each EU member state has a different number of seats in the European Parliament, allocated based on its population. The total number of MEPs is currently 705, but this will change to 708 after Brexit.

3. **What does the European Parliament do?**
   - The EP shares legislative power with the Council of the European Union (the body representing the member states). Together, they adopt EU laws and pass the EU budget.
   - The EP also has the power to scrutinize and approve the European Commission, the executive branch of the EU. It can also dismiss the Commission through a motion of censure.
   - MEPs (Members of the European Parliament) work in political groups rather than

The Visit of the EU Institutions is an annual event organized by the European Parliament and the European Commission for young people from all over the EU. The main purpose of this visit is to give young people the opportunity to learn more about how the EU works, its institutions, and its policies. Here's what you can expect from this visit:

2. **Educational Activities**: You'll participate in various educational activities and workshops that will help you understand the EU's decision-making process, its history, and its impact on your daily life. These activities can include visits to EU institutions, meetings with EU officials, and interactive games and simulations.

4. **Cultural Visits**: Apart from the educational activities, you'll also have the chance to explore the city where the event is held. This could be Brussels, Strasbourg, or Luxembourg, depending on the year. You'll visit historical sites, museums, and other cultural attractions.

5. **Personal Development**: The visit can help you develop important skills like communication, teamwork, and problem-solving. It can also boost your confidence and broaden your horizons.

To participate, you usually need to apply through your school or a local organization. The EU covers most of the costs, including travel, accommodation, and meals. However, the number of places is limited, so competition can be high.

Q5_56_ I am 14 years old and from Poland. I know not at all about The European Youth Week or the European Youth Event. Can you tell me more about this? I would like to participate in this event.

The European Youth Week and the European Youth Event (EYE) are initiatives organized by the European Parliament to engage young people in the democratic life of the European Union. Here's a brief overview of both events:

1. **European Youth Week (EYW)**: This is an annual event that takes place in early May. It aims to celebrate and promote youth engagement, participation, and active citizenship across Europe. The EYW is a decentralized event, meaning it's organized locally in each EU Member State by national authorities, with the support of the European Commission and the European Parliament. Activities can vary, but they often include workshops, debates, and cultural events focused on topics relevant to young people, such as education, employment, digitalization, and environmental protection.

   To participate, you should check the official EYW website for more information about the events happening in your country: https://europa.eu/youth/week_en

2. **European Youth Event (EYE)**: The EYE is a biennial event held in the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France. It brings together thousands of young people from all over Europe to discuss and debate on various topics related to the EU's policies and priorities. The event includes workshops, debates, exhibitions, and cultural activities. It's a great opportunity for young people to make their voices heard, learn about the EU's decision-making process, and connect with other young Europeans.

Q5_57_ I am 14 years old and from Poland. I know not at all about Contacting a Commissioner or an MEP. Can you tell me more about this? I would like to contact them about the topic of climate change.

I would like to know how to contact them and what to write in the letter. I would like to know what is the difference between a Commissioner and an MEP.

I would like to know if I can contact them in English or Polish.

Thank you for your help.

Dear Kamil,

It's great to hear that you're interested in engaging with European Union (EU) officials about climate change. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you:

1. **Commissioner vs MEP:**
   - **Commissioner:** They are part of the European Commission, the executive branch of the EU. They are responsible for proposing and implementing new laws and policies. There are 27 Commissioners, one from each EU member state. They work together to ensure the EU's goals and values are put into practice.
   - **MEP (Member of the European Parliament):** They are part of the European Parliament, the legislative branch of the EU. There are 705 MEPs in total, elected every five years by EU citizens. They represent EU citizens' interests and have the power to amend and adopt new laws.

2. **How to contact them:**
   - **Commissioner:** You can find the contact details of each Commissioner on the European Commission's website. Here's the link: https://ec.europa.eu/commission/president/commissioners_en
   - **MEP:** You can find the contact details of MEPs on the European Parliament's website. Here's the link: https://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/search.html

3. **What to write in your letter:**
   - Be clear and concise. Explain who you are, where you're from, and why you're writing.
   - Explain your concerns about climate change and why you think it's important.
   - Be specific about what you'd like

Q5_59_ I am 14 years old and from Poland. I know not at all about European Citizens’ Initiative. Can you tell me more about this? What is it? How can I participate? What are the benefits of this initiative?

The European Citizens’ Initiative (ECI) is a unique tool for EU citizens to participate directly in the EU policy-making process. It was introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon in 2009 and allows EU citizens to propose new legislation in areas where the European Commission has the power to propose laws. Here’s a simple breakdown:

1. **What is the European Citizens’ Initiative (ECI)?**
   - It’s a way for EU citizens to propose new legislation in areas where the European Commission has the power to propose laws.
   - It’s a tool for citizens to express their opinion on issues they care about and to influence EU policy.
   - It’s a way to strengthen democracy and bring EU citizens closer to the EU institutions.

2. **How can you participate?**
   - To start an ECI, you need to be a citizen of the EU and have the support of at least one million EU citizens from at least seven different EU countries.
   - You need to register your ECI with the European Commission. This involves submitting a proposal that includes a description of the issue, the proposed legal act, and a statement of the reasons for the proposal.
   - Once your ECI is registered, you need to collect signatures from at least one million EU citizens from at least seven different EU countries within one year. You can do this online or using a paper form.
   - If you collect enough signatures, the European Commission will examine your proposal and decide whether to take action. If the Commission decides not to take action, it must explain why.

3. **Benefits of the ECI:**
   - It gives EU citizens a direct say in EU policy-making.
   - It allows citizens to raise issues that they care about and that might not otherwise be addressed by the EU institutions.
   - It can help to build a European public sphere and foster debate among EU citizens about
