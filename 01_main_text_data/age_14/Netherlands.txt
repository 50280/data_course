Q3_30_ I am 14 years old and from Netherlands. I have never taken part in activities that relate to democratic participation because I don’t understand the issues enough. For my friends, this is kind of the same. Can you tell me more about how I can do that? I want to be more involved in the democratic process.

Thank you for your question. It's great to hear that you're interested in becoming more involved in the democratic process. Here are some ways you can start:

1. **Educate Yourself**: The first step is to learn about the issues that matter to you. This could be anything from climate change, to education policies, to local community issues. Websites like News in Levels, BBC Newsround, and National Geographic Kids can help you understand complex issues in a way that's easy to grasp.

2. **Join a Club or Group**: There might be clubs or groups at your school or in your community that focus on issues you care about. Joining these can help you meet like-minded people and learn more about how to make a difference. If there aren't any, you could start your own!

3. **Participate in School Activities**: Many schools have student councils or other ways for students to have a say in school decisions. This can be a great way to start understanding how democratic processes work.

4. **Attend Local Meetings**: Many local governments have meetings that are open to the public. Attending these can give you a firsthand look at how decisions are made. You might not be able to vote yet, but you can still have a voice by speaking at these meetings or writing to your local representatives.

5. **Volunteer**: Volunteering for a cause you care about can be a great way to learn more about the issues and how you can make a difference. It also looks great on college applications!

6. **Use Your Voice on Social Media**: While it's important to be careful about what you share online, social media can be a powerful tool for raising awareness about issues you care about. You can use platforms like Instagram, TikTok, or Twitter to share your thoughts and connect with others.

7. **Talk to Your Family and Friends**: Discussing the issues with the people

Dear 14-year-old,

It's great to hear that you're interested in democratic participation! There are several ways you can get involved, even if you're limited by distance or transportation. Here are some suggestions:

1. **Online Platforms**: Many organizations and governments now offer online platforms for young people to have their say. These can be a great way to participate from home. Here are a few examples:
   - **Youth Voice**: This is a platform by the Dutch government where you can share your ideas and opinions on various topics. (https://www.jongerenstemmen.nl/)
   - **DemocracyLab**: This is an international platform where young people can discuss and vote on global issues. (https://democracylab.org/)
   - **Change.org**: You can start or sign petitions on this global platform. (https://www.change.org/)

2. **Local Youth Councils or Youth Parliaments**: These are often organized by local governments and can be a great way to learn about local issues and have a say in decision-making processes. Even if the meetings are held in person, some may offer virtual participation options.

3. **School Activities**: Your school might have clubs or activities related to democracy, politics, or social issues. These can be a good starting point for getting involved.

4. **Volunteering**: You can volunteer for local organizations or causes that you care about. This can be a hands-on way to participate in democratic processes and make a difference in your community.

5. **Social Media**: Many organizations and politicians use social media to engage with young people. Following them and participating in online discussions can be a way to have your voice heard.

6. **Write Letters or Emails**: You can write to local politicians, members of parliament, or other decision-makers to share your thoughts and ideas. Many have email addresses or online contact forms on their

While these events are not specifically for youth, they are open to everyone, including young people. Here's how you can participate:

   - **Online**: Keep an eye on the European Commission's website for announcements about upcoming Citizens' Dialogues. Some of these events are held online, making it easier for you to participate.

Q5_56_ I am 14 years old and from Netherlands. I know not at all about The European Youth Week or the European Youth Event. Can you tell me more about this? I would like to know what it is, when it is and how I can participate.

The European Youth Week (EYW) and the European Youth Event (EYE) are initiatives organized by the European Parliament to engage young people in the democratic life of the European Union (EU). Here's some information about both events:

1. **European Youth Week (EYW):**
   - **What is it?** The EYW is an annual event that takes place in different European cities, organized by the European Parliament in cooperation with local authorities. It aims to bring young people together to discuss and debate European topics, learn about the EU's institutions and values, and encourage their active participation in democratic life.

Participating in EU events related to climate change and sustainability can be a great way to learn, engage, and make a difference. Here are some ways you can get involved:

1. **EU Climate Pact**: The EU Climate Pact is an initiative that brings together individuals, organizations, and governments to share ideas and take action on climate change. They organize various events and activities. You can join local or online events, or even start your own initiative. Visit the official website to learn more: <https://www.eucitizen.climateaction.eu/>

2. **EU Green Week**: This is the biggest annual event on European environment policy. It brings together policymakers, leading environmentalists, stakeholders, and other interested parties to debate and discuss environmental issues. While the main event is held in Brussels, many EU countries organize local events and activities. Keep an eye on the official website for updates: <https://www.eugreenweek.eu/>

3. **EU Climate Diplomacy Week**: This is an annual event that takes place in various EU Member States and partner countries. It aims to raise awareness of climate change and showcase climate action initiatives. You can find more information and local events on the official website: <https://www.climate-diplomacy.org/week>

These can range from workshops and conferences to community clean-up days and tree-planting events. Check your local municipality's website or social media channels for updates.

5. **EU-funded projects**: The EU funds many projects related to climate change and sustainability. These projects often involve public participation and can provide opportunities to learn and engage. You can find a list of funded projects on the official EU website: <https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/en/h20
Q5_59_ I am 14 years old and from Netherlands. I know not at all about European Citizens’ Initiative. Can you tell me more about this? What is it? How does it work? What is the purpose of it? And how can I participate?

The European Citizens’ Initiative (ECI) is a unique tool for EU citizens to participate directly in the EU’s democratic life. It was introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon in 2009 and has been in operation since 2012. Here’s a simple breakdown to help you understand it:

**What is the European Citizens’ Initiative (ECI)?**
The ECI is a way for citizens of the European Union (EU) to propose new legislation directly to the European Commission. It allows EU citizens to come together to suggest changes to EU policies or laws.

**How does it work?**
1. **Registration**: A group of at least 7 EU citizens from at least 7 different EU Member States can register an ECI with the European Commission.
2. **Collection of signatures**: The organisers then have one year to collect at least one million signatures from EU citizens in support of their proposal. These signatures must come from at least 7 different Member States, and the number of signatures from each Member State must be proportional to the size of its population.
3. **Validation**: The European Commission checks the signatures to ensure they are valid. If the ECI reaches the one million threshold, the Commission will decide whether to take action on the proposal. This could involve proposing new legislation, or explaining why the proposal cannot be implemented.

**What is the purpose of the ECI?**
The purpose of the ECI is to give EU citizens a direct say in the EU’s decision-making process. It aims to increase democratic participation and transparency at the EU level. It also helps the European Commission to understand the concerns and priorities of EU citizens.

**How can you participate?**
As you are 14 years old, you are not eligible to sign an ECI or to be a member of the citizens’ committee that organises it. However,
