Q5_52_ I am 14 years old and from Sweden. I know not at all about Public consultations. Can you tell me more about this? What is it? How does it work? What is the purpose of it? And how can I participate in it?

Public consultations are a way for governments, organizations, or other bodies to gather information and opinions from the public on a particular issue or policy. They are often used to inform decision-making processes and ensure that the views of the public are taken into account. Here's a breakdown of your questions:

1. **What is a public consultation?**
   A public consultation is a process where an organization or government body seeks input from the public on a specific topic. This could be about a new policy, a proposed project, or a change in existing rules. The goal is to engage with the public, understand their concerns, and incorporate their feedback into the decision-making process.

2. **How does it work?**
   Public consultations can take many forms, such as:
   - **Online surveys or questionnaires**: These are often the most common method, allowing people to share their views electronically.
   - **Public meetings or hearings**: These are in-person events where people can speak directly to decision-makers or provide written comments.
   - **Focus groups or workshops**: These are smaller, more structured discussions led by a facilitator.
   - **Written submissions**: Some consultations may accept written submissions, such as letters or emails.

3. **What is the purpose of it?**
   The primary purpose of public consultations is to:
   - **Involve the public**: Engage with people who will be affected by the decision or who have an interest in the topic.
   - **Gather information**: Collect a wide range of views, ideas, and evidence to inform the decision-making process.
   - **Build support**: By involving the public, organizations can build support for their decisions and improve the likelihood of successful implementation.
   - **Meet legal requirements**: In some cases, public consultations are required by law to ensure that decisions are made transparently and democratically.

Q5_59_ I am 14 years old and from Sweden. I know not at all about European Citizens’ Initiative. Can you tell me more about this? What is it and how does it work?

The European Citizens’ Initiative (ECI) is a unique tool for EU citizens to participate directly in the EU’s democratic life. It was introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon in 2009 and has been in operation since 2012. Here’s a simple breakdown of how it works:

1. **Who can propose an ECI?**
   - Any EU citizen, or a group of EU citizens, can propose an ECI. You need to be a citizen of an EU country and have the right to vote in European Parliament elections.

2. **What can an ECI be about?**
   - An ECI can be about any area of EU policy, except for areas where the EU has no competence, such as taxation, defense, and social security.

   - To propose an ECI, you need to register your initiative on the European Commission’s website. You’ll need to provide a proposal title, a summary, and a detailed explanation of your initiative. You’ll also need to gather support from at least one million EU citizens from at least seven different EU countries.

4. **Gathering support:**
   - Once your initiative is registered, you have one year to gather support. You can do this online, using the Commission’s online collection system, or through national collection systems. Each supporter must be an EU citizen and provide their name, age, address, and nationality.

5. **What happens if an ECI gathers enough support?**
   - If your initiative gathers at least one million statements of support within one year, the European Commission will examine it. If it falls within the EU’s competence and is not manifestly abusive, the Commission will decide whether to take action.

6. **What kind of action can the Commission take?**
   - The Commission can decide to:
     - Take action at EU level if it considers the
