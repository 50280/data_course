Q3_30_ I am 14 years old and from Hungary. I have never taken part in activities that relate to democratic participation because I don’t understand the issues enough. For my friends, this is not at all the same. Can you tell me more about how I can do that? What are the benefits of participating in democratic activities?

Democratic participation is a crucial aspect of a healthy society, and it's great that you're interested in learning more about it. Here are some ways you can get involved and some benefits of doing so:

1. **Educate Yourself**: The first step is to learn about the issues that matter to you. This could be anything from local community issues to global problems like climate change or social inequality. Read books, watch documentaries, and follow reliable news sources to stay informed.

2. **Join Clubs or Groups**: Many schools and communities have clubs or groups focused on social issues, politics, or advocacy. Joining one of these can help you connect with like-minded individuals and learn more about how to make a difference.

3. **Volunteer**: Volunteering for local organizations or causes you care about can give you hands-on experience in democratic participation. It also allows you to see the impact of your actions on your community.

Dear friend,

It's wonderful to hear that you're interested in democratic participation! At your age, there are many ways you can get involved and make your voice heard. Here are some suggestions:

1. **School Council or Student Government**: Many schools have student councils or governments where students can participate in decision-making processes. If your school doesn't have one, you could start a petition to create one. This is a great way to learn about leadership, teamwork, and advocacy.

2. **Youth Parliaments**: Some countries have youth parliaments where young people can role-play as members of parliament, debate issues, and learn about the legislative process. You might want to look into if there's one in Hungary or if there are any international ones you can participate in.

3. **Volunteering**: Volunteering for local community projects or non-profit organizations can give you a sense of civic responsibility and allow you to contribute to your community. It can also help you understand the needs and challenges of your community better.

4. **Online Petitions and Campaigns**: Websites like Change.org allow you to start or sign petitions on issues you care about. You can also participate in online campaigns and advocacy efforts.

5. **Social Media**: Platforms like Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook can be used to raise awareness about issues and start conversations. You can follow and engage with local politicians, join groups related to causes you care about, and share your opinions.

6. **Local Youth Clubs or Organizations**: There might be local youth clubs or organizations in your area that focus on democratic participation, human rights, or social issues. Joining these can provide you with opportunities to learn and participate.

7. **Educational Programs**: There are often educational programs and workshops designed to teach young people about democracy, human rights, and civic participation. These can be a great way to learn more and meet like-minded people.

I would like to participate in the democratic process, but I don't know how to do it.

Dear young friend,

It's wonderful to hear that you're interested in participating in the democratic process, even at your young age. There are indeed many ways you can get involved, even if you're not able to physically attend events or meetings. Here are some suggestions:

1. **Online Platforms**: Many organizations and governments now have online platforms where you can voice your opinions, participate in discussions, and even vote on certain issues. Some examples include:
   - Youth-led organizations like the European Youth Forum (https://www.youthforum.org/) or the European Youth Parliament (https://www.eyp.org/) have online platforms where you can engage with other young people and participate in discussions.
   - Your local government's website might have an online platform for citizen engagement. In Hungary, for instance, the government has an online platform called "Kormány.hu" where you can find information about various topics and even submit your ideas or suggestions.

2. **Social Media**: Many organizations and politicians use social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram to engage with their audience. You can follow them, join their groups, and participate in the discussions. This is a great way to stay informed and voice your opinions.

3. **Petitions and Online Campaigns**: Websites like Change.org allow you to start or sign petitions on issues you care about. These can be a powerful way to raise awareness and influence decision-makers.

4. **Youth Councils and Youth Parliaments**: Some cities and countries have youth councils or youth parliaments where young people can represent their peers and participate in decision-making processes. While these are typically in-person, some may have online components or you could reach out to them to express your interest and see if there are any opportunities for remote participation.

5. **Volunteering and Community Service**: While not directly related to democratic participation,

Q4b_44_ I am 14 years old and from Hungary. I am a little interested in changing society in the area of Equal rights regardless of gender, race or sexuality. Can you tell me how I can do this? I know it's a big question but I would really appreciate any advice.

Thank you for your question. It's wonderful to see young people like you taking an interest in social issues and wanting to make a positive change. Here are some steps you can take to start advocating for equal rights:

1. **Educate Yourself**: Learn about the issues you're passionate about.

Some recommended books include "Why I'm No Longer Talking to White People About Race" by Reni Eddo-Lodge, "We Should All Be Feminists" by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, and "Redefining Realness" by Janet Mock.

2. **Engage in Conversations**: Talk to your friends, family, and community about these issues. Share what you've learned and listen to others' perspectives. Remember, everyone has different experiences and viewpoints, and it's important to approach these conversations with empathy and respect.

3. **Get Involved in Local Initiatives**: Look for local organizations or groups that align with your values. They might be organizing protests, awareness campaigns, or community service projects. You can also start your own initiative, like a school club or a community event.

4. **Use Your Voice Online**: Social media can be a powerful tool for raising awareness. Share informative posts, use relevant hashtags, and engage with others in online discussions. Remember to always be respectful and constructive in your interactions.

5. **Write Letters or Petitions**: Write letters to local politicians, school administrators, or other decision-makers about issues you care about. You can also start petitions on platforms like Change.org to gather support for a cause.

6. **Participate in Protests and Marches**: These events can be a powerful way to show solidarity and raise awareness. Make sure to follow all safety guidelines and local laws.

Q5_58_ I am 14 years old and from Hungary. I know  about Participation in events organised by the EU in your country. Can you tell me more about this? What kind of events are there? How can I participate in them? What are the benefits of participating in these events?

Participating in events organised by the EU can be a great way to learn more about the European Union, its policies, and its impact on your country and the wider world. Here are some types of events you might find interesting:

1. **EU Information Days**: These events are organised by the EU Delegation or the EU Information Office in your country to provide information about EU policies, funding opportunities, and how the EU affects your daily life. They often include presentations, workshops, and Q&A sessions.

2. **EU-funded Projects**: Many EU-funded projects organise events, such as conferences, workshops, or training sessions, to share their results and engage with the public. These can cover a wide range of topics, from research and innovation to culture and education.

3. **EU Youth Dialogue**: This is a platform for young people to engage with EU decision-makers and share their ideas and concerns. It includes local, national, and European events, as well as online consultations.

4. **EU Competitions and Contests**: The EU organises various competitions and contests for young people, such as the EU Youth Essay Competition or the EU's "Europe for Citizens" programme, which includes competitions and events.

5. **EU Events in Schools**: Some EU programmes, like Erasmus+, organise events and workshops in schools to raise awareness about EU opportunities for young people.

To participate in these events, you can:

1. **Check the EU Delegation's or EU Information Office's website** for your country. They usually publish information about upcoming events and how to register.

2. **Follow EU-funded projects** in your country. Many of them have websites or social media profiles where they announce their events.

3. **Join EU online platforms and forums** for young people, like the EU Youth Portal or the EU's "Have Your Say" platform. They
Q5_59_ I am 14 years old and from Hungary. I know not at all about European Citizens’ Initiative. Can you tell me more about this? What is it? How can I participate? What are the benefits of it?

The European Citizens’ Initiative (ECI) is a unique tool for EU citizens to participate directly in the EU’s democratic life. It allows you to call on the European Commission to propose new legislation in areas where the Commission has the power to do so. Here’s a simple breakdown:

1. **What is it?**
   The ECI is a way for EU citizens to influence EU policy-making. It was introduced in 2012 as part of the Treaty of Lisbon to give citizens a direct say in EU law-making. It's the first transnational tool of participatory democracy at the EU level.

2. **How does it work?**
   - **Initiation**: Any EU citizen, or a group of citizens, can initiate an ECI. They need to collect signatures from at least one million EU citizens from at least seven different Member States within one year.
   - **Registration**: The European Commission checks if the initiative meets the legal requirements. If it does, the Commission registers the ECI and it can start collecting signatures.
   - **Signature collection**: Signatures can be collected online or on paper. Each signature must be certified by a competent authority in the Member State where the signatory resides.
   - **Verification**: After the one-year period, the Commission verifies the signatures. If the initiative has collected at least one million valid signatures, the Commission has to decide whether to take action or not. If it decides not to, it must explain why.

3. **How can you participate?**
   - **Support an ECI**: You can support an ongoing ECI by signing it. You can find a list of ongoing ECIs on the European Commission's website.
   - **Initiate an ECI**: If you're at least 18 years old and have the support of at least seven other EU citizens, you can initiate an ECI.
