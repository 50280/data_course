Dear Friend,

It's wonderful to hear that you're interested in democratic participation! Even at your age, there are many ways you can get involved and make your voice heard. Here are some ideas:

1. **School Council or Student Council**: Many schools have a council where students can voice their opinions and ideas. If your school doesn't have one, you could suggest starting one. You could help organize school events, improve the school environment, or even suggest changes to school rules.

2. **Youth Parliament**: Some countries have youth parliaments where young people can learn about democracy and have their say on issues that matter to them. In Ireland, for example, there's the Irish Youth Parliament. You might want to look into if there's something similar in your country.

3. **Local Community Activities**: You could get involved in local community activities or projects. This could be anything from helping with a community garden, to volunteering at a local charity, or even starting a community project of your own.

4. **Write to Your Local Representatives**: You can write letters or emails to your local politicians to share your thoughts and ideas. They represent you, so they should be interested in hearing what you have to say.

5. **Join a Club or Group**: Joining a club or group that focuses on issues you care about can be a great way to learn more and make your voice heard. This could be anything from an environmental group to a sports team.

6. **Start a Petition**: If there's an issue you care about, you could start a petition. Websites like Change.org make it easy for anyone to start a petition.

7. **Educate Yourself**: The more you know about how democracy works and the issues that are important, the better equipped you'll be to participate. You could read books, watch documentaries, or talk to people about these topics.

8. **Talk to Your Family and Friends**: Discussing your

Q4b_41_ I am 9 years old and from Ireland. I am a little interested in changing society in the area of Climate change and environmental protection. Can you tell me how I can do this? I am not sure where to start.

Dear 9-year-old,

It's wonderful to hear that you're already thinking about how to make a difference in the world, especially when it comes to climate change and environmental protection. Here are some steps you can take to start making a positive impact:

1. **Educate Yourself**: Learn more about climate change and environmental issues. There are many age-appropriate books, documentaries, and websites that can help you understand these topics better. Some recommendations include "The Lorax" by Dr. Seuss, "The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind" by William Kamkwamba, and the website FuseSchool (https://www.fuseschool.org/).

2. **Talk to Others**: Share what you've learned with your family, friends, and classmates. You can start conversations about climate change and encourage others to care about the environment too. You might even inspire them to take action alongside you.

3. **Start Small at Home**: There are many ways you can help protect the environment at home. Here are a few ideas:
   - Turn off lights and electronics when you're not using them to save energy.
   - Use reusable water bottles and bags instead of single-use plastic ones.
   - Recycle paper, plastic, and metal.
   - Help with composting food waste.
   - Plant trees or flowers to help absorb carbon dioxide and provide habitats for wildlife.

4. **Get Involved in School**: See if your school has an environmental club or if you can start one. You can organize activities like tree planting, beach clean-ups, or awareness campaigns. You can also encourage your school to adopt more eco-friendly practices, like using energy-efficient light bulbs or reducing food waste.

5. **Participate in Community Events**: Look for local events focused on environmental protection, like community clean-ups, tree planting days, or climate marches. These are great opportunities to meet like-minded people and learn from others

Dear Eimear,

It's wonderful to hear that you're already thinking about how to make a positive impact on society, especially in the area of health and well-being. Here are some steps and ideas to help you get started:

1. **Identify the specific issue you want to address**: You mentioned you have a few ideas, so take some time to think about which one you'd like to focus on first. It could be promoting physical activity, improving mental health awareness, reducing screen time, or something else that you're passionate about.

2. **Research**: Once you've chosen your focus, learn as much as you can about it. Read books, watch documentaries, and talk to experts (like teachers, doctors, or counselors) to understand the issue better. This will help you come up with effective solutions.

3. **Set clear goals**: What do you hope to achieve with your project? Make sure your goals are SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound). For example, "I want to encourage my school to have a daily 15-minute physical activity break within the next three months."

4. **Create a plan**: Break down your goals into smaller, manageable tasks. Here's an example of how you could structure your plan:

   a. **Research and preparation** (2 weeks)
      - Learn about the benefits of physical activity breaks.
      - Find fun and engaging activities suitable for your school.
      - Prepare a presentation to pitch your idea to your teachers and classmates.

   b. **Gather support** (2 weeks)
      - Share your idea with your classmates and ask for their feedback and support.
      - Talk to your teachers and school administrators about your plan.

   c. **Implement your project** (

Q5_51_ I am 9 years old and from Ireland. I know not at all about Citizens’ dialogue, EU Youth Dialogue or EU Youth Conference. Can you tell me more about this? I am very interested in learning more about this.

Dear friend,

I'm delighted to hear about your interest in learning more about the EU Youth Dialogue, Citizens' Dialogues, and the EU Youth Conference. These are fantastic initiatives that give young people like you a chance to have your voice heard and to engage with European politics. Let's break down each of these:

1. **EU Youth Dialogue**: This is a platform created by the European Commission to involve young people in policy-making processes related to youth. It's a way for the EU to listen to and learn from young people's experiences, ideas, and concerns. The dialogue focuses on various topics, such as education, employment, participation, and digital youth work. Here's how you can get involved:
   - Join the EU Youth Dialogue online platform (https://europa.eu/youth/youth-dialogue_en) to share your ideas and opinions.
   - Participate in local, national, or regional events organized by your country's National Agency for Erasmus+ Youth.

2. **Citizens' Dialogues**: These are public events organized by the European Commission to engage with EU citizens and discuss various EU policies and initiatives. They provide a space for open and informal conversations between EU officials and citizens. While these events are not specifically for young people, they are open to everyone, including you! You can find out more about upcoming Citizens' Dialogues on the European Commission's website (https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/12664-Open-Citizens-Dialogues_en).

Q5_52_ I am 9 years old and from Ireland. I know not at all about Public consultations. Can you tell me more about this? I am interested in learning about this.

Hello! It's great to hear that you're interested in learning about public consultations. I'll explain it in a simple way so it's easy to understand.

A public consultation is like a big conversation between people and the government, or other important organizations. It's a way for them to listen to what people think about certain topics or plans. Here's how it works:

1. **The Topic**: The government or organization wants to talk about a specific topic. This could be something like building a new park, changing rules for schools, or making new laws. They want to know what people think about this topic.

2. **The Invitation**: They invite everyone to join the conversation. This is usually done by putting information on their website, in newspapers, or by sending letters to people who might be affected by the topic.

3. **Your Voice**: You can share your thoughts, ideas, or concerns about the topic. This is your chance to tell the government or organization what you think. You can do this by filling out a form, writing a letter, or even talking to them at a special meeting.

4. **Listening**: The government or organization listens to what everyone has to say. They might get lots of different ideas and opinions, and they try to understand what most people think.

5. **Making Decisions**: After listening to everyone, they make a decision about what to do. Sometimes, they might change their plans based on what they heard from people. Other times, they might decide to go ahead with their original plan. They usually explain why they made the decision they did.

6. **Sharing the Results**: After the consultation, they share what they found out and what decision they made. They might do this on their website, in a report, or by telling people at a meeting.

So, a public consultation is like a big, important conversation where everyone can have their say. It's a way

   - **Contact them**: You can send an email to the Commissioner's cabinet using the contact form on their webpage. Here's the link to Commissioner Sinkevičius' page: https://ec.europa.eu/commission/commissioners/2019-2024/sinkevicius_en

2. **MEPs (Members of the European Parliament)**: The European Parliament is the legislative branch of the EU, responsible for passing laws. MEPs are elected by EU citizens to represent their interests and concerns. Here's how you can contact them:

   - **Find your MEPs**: Since you're from Ireland, you'll have MEPs from the Republic of Ireland or Northern Ireland. You can find out who they are and their contact details on the European Parliament's website: https://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/search.html
   - **Contact them**: You can send an email or a letter to your MEPs, explaining your concerns about the environment and any ideas

Dear friend,

I'm delighted to help you understand the European Citizens' Initiative (ECI) in a simple and fun way!

Imagine you have a great idea that you think could make Europe a better place. The ECI is like a special way for you and other Europeans to tell the European Commission (that's like the government of Europe) about your idea. Here's how it works:

1. **Collect signatures**: First, you need to find other people who like your idea. You need to collect at least one million signatures from at least seven different European countries. That's like having a big, Europe-wide petition.

2. **Register your initiative**: Once you have your signatures, you need to register your initiative with the European Commission. They will check if your idea is legal and if it's something they can do something about.

3. **The Commission decides**: If your initiative is registered, the European Commission will decide if they want to take action on your idea. They might make a new law, change an existing one, or even just say why they can't do what you're asking.

4. **The European Parliament and Council decide**: If the Commission likes your idea, they will propose a legal act. Then, the European Parliament (like a big group of elected representatives from all over Europe) and the Council of the European Union (which represents the governments of the member states) will decide if they want to make your idea into a law.

So, the ECI is a way for Europeans to have a say in how Europe is run. It's like a big, collective way to share your ideas and make a difference! Even though you're 9 years old, you can still learn about it and maybe even help with an ECI in the future. Keep up your interest in European affairs, and who knows what you might achieve!
