Q3_32_ I am 9 years old and from Poland. I have never taken part in activities that relate to democratic participation because I did not know that I could do this. For my friends, this is kind of the same. Can you tell me more about how I can do that? I would like to do something for my community.

Thank you for your question! It's great that you're interested in getting involved in your community and learning about democratic participation. Here are some ways you can start:

If your school doesn't have one, you could start a petition to create one. You could help organize school events, improve school facilities, or suggest changes to school rules.

2. **Community Clean-Up**: You could organize or join a community clean-up event. This not only helps your community but also shows that you care about the environment. You could start by talking to your parents, teachers, or local community leaders about this.

3. **Fundraising**: You could organize a fundraiser for a local charity or cause you care about. This could be a bake sale, a car wash, or a sponsored event like a walk or run.

4. **Youth Parliament or Youth Council**: Some cities and countries have youth parliaments or youth councils where young people can learn about democracy and have a say in local decisions. You could ask your parents or teachers to help you find out if there's one in your area.

6. **Volunteering**: You could volunteer at a local charity or community organization. This could be anything from helping at an animal shelter to reading to elderly people.

7. **Environmental Initiatives**: You could start a recycling program at your school or in your neighborhood. You could also plant trees or create a community garden.

8. **Art and Creativity**: You could use your artistic talents to create murals, posters, or videos

Dear friend,

It's wonderful to hear that you're interested in democratic participation at such a young age! There are many ways you can get involved and make a difference, even if you're not able to attend in-person events. Here are some suggestions:

1. **Local Volunteer Work**: Look for local organizations or charities that focus on helping people in need. You can ask your parents to help you find opportunities where you can volunteer your time. This could be anything from helping at a local animal shelter, participating in community clean-up events, or assisting at a food bank.

You can create posters, give presentations at school, or even start a social media campaign (with your parents' permission and supervision).

2. **Citizens' Dialogue**: Imagine you're having a conversation with your friends about something you all care about, like your favorite game or a book you've read. Now, imagine that conversation happening on a larger scale, with people from different EU countries, talking about important topics that affect everyone in the EU. That's what a Citizens' Dialogue is like! It's a way for EU citizens to share their thoughts, ideas, and concerns with each other and with EU decision-makers. These dialogues can happen in many forms, like public events, online discussions, or even through written contributions.

3. **EU Youth Dialogue**: The EU Youth Dialogue is a special part of the Citizens' Dialogue, focused on young people like you. It's a way for young Europeans to have their say on issues that matter to them. The EU Youth Dialogue helps young people to:

   - Meet and connect with other young people from different EU countries.

Q5_53_ I am 9 years old and from Poland. I know kind of about European elections. Can you tell me more about this? What are they? When are they? Who can vote? What are the results?

Thank you for your question! I'm glad to help you understand the European elections.

1. **What are European elections?**
   European elections are a democratic process where citizens of the European Union (EU) elect members of the European Parliament (EP), which is the legislative body of the European Union. These elections are held every five years.

2. **When are they held?**
   The last European elections were held in 2019, and the next ones are scheduled for 2024. They usually take place in late May or early June.

3. **Who can vote?**
   Any EU citizen who is at least 18 years old (the voting age varies slightly among EU countries) can vote in European elections. They can vote in their home country or, if they live in another EU country, they can vote there instead. This is to ensure that EU citizens living abroad can still have a say in the European Parliament's composition.

4. **What are the results?**
   The results of the European elections determine the composition of the European Parliament. Here's a simplified explanation of what happens next:

   - **Spitzenkandidaten process**: Before the elections, major European political parties put forward a "lead candidate" or "Spitzenkandidat" for the position of European Commission President. The candidate of the party that wins the most seats in the European Parliament is usually proposed as the Commission President by the European Council (the heads of state or government of the EU member countries).

   - **Formation of the European Parliament**: After the elections, the newly elected members of the European Parliament (MEPs) gather in Strasbourg, France, for the first plenary session. They elect the President of the European Parliament, who will serve for a two-and-a-half-year term.

   - **Formation of the European Commission**: The new European Commission,

Q5_55_ I am 9 years old and from Poland. I know not at all about Visit of the EU institutions. Can you tell me more about this? What is the EU? What are the EU institutions? What is the Visit of the EU institutions?

The EU, or European Union, is a group of 27 countries that work together to make decisions about many things, like trade, travel, and the environment. This helps them to cooperate and make life better for the people who live in these countries.

The EU has several institutions that help it to function and make decisions. Here are a few of the most important ones:

1. **European Parliament**: This is like the parliament of the EU. It's made up of elected members from each of the EU countries. They make laws and decide how the EU's budget should be spent.

2. **European Commission**: This is like the government of the EU. It's led by a President and has 27 Commissioners, one from each EU country. They propose new laws and make sure that EU countries follow the rules.

3. **Council of the European Union**: This is where representatives from each EU country meet to make decisions. They can be ministers or other government officials, depending on the topic being discussed.

4. **European Council**: This is where the heads of state or government of each EU country meet. They set the EU's overall political direction.

5. **European Court of Justice**: This is the highest court in the EU. It makes sure that EU law is followed and solves disputes between EU countries, EU institutions, and private citizens or companies.

Now, about the "Visit of the EU institutions": This is not a specific event, but rather a general term for when people, like you, visit the EU institutions. Many of the EU institutions are open to the public and offer visits, tours, or exhibitions. These visits can help you learn more about how the EU works and what it does. Some institutions even have special programs for children and young people.

For example, the European Parliament has a "Youth Parliament" program where young people can

The European Youth Week and the European Youth Event are two different events, but they are both organized by the European Union and they are both focused on young people. Here is some information about each of them:

1. European Youth Week:
The European Youth Week is an annual event that takes place in different cities across Europe. It is organized by the European Commission and it aims to celebrate and promote youth participation, creativity, and active citizenship. During the week, various activities and events are organized by local, regional, and national authorities, as well as by youth organizations and other stakeholders. These activities can include workshops, debates, concerts, and sports tournaments, among others. The European Youth Week is open to young people aged 13 to 30, and it is a great opportunity for them to get involved in their communities, meet new people, and learn about different cultures. The next European Youth Week will take place from 27 April to 3 May 2023, and the theme is "Youth for democracy".

2. European Youth Event (EYE):
The European Youth Event is a biennial event that takes place in the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France. It is organized by the European Parliament and it brings together thousands of young people from all over Europe to discuss and debate about the future of Europe. During the event, young people can participate in workshops, debates, and simulations, and they can also meet with Members of the European Parliament and other decision-makers. The EYE is open to young people aged 16 to 30, and it is a unique opportunity for them to have their say on the future of Europe and to learn about the European Union and its institutions.

Q5_57_ I am 9 years old and from Poland. I know not at all about Contacting a Commissioner or an MEP. Can you tell me more about this? I would like to ask them about the environment and climate change.

Dear 9-year-old,

It's wonderful to hear that you're already thinking about the environment and climate change at such a young age! You're right, contacting a Commissioner or a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) can be a great way to share your thoughts and concerns about these important issues. Here's a simple step-by-step guide on how you can do this:

1. **Find the right person to contact:**
   - **European Commissioners:** The European Commission has 27 Commissioners, each responsible for a different policy area. You might want to contact the Commissioner for Environment, Oceans and Fisheries, Virginijus Sinkevičius. You can find his contact details here: https://ec.europa.eu/environment/ commissioners_en
   - **MEPs:** MEPs are elected to represent EU citizens in the European Parliament. You can find your local MEP by entering your postcode on this website: https://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/search

2. **Write your message:**
   - Be clear and concise. Explain who you are, where you're from, and why you're writing.
   - Share your thoughts and concerns about the environment and climate change. What do you think needs to be done? What changes would you like to see?
   - You can also ask questions if you're curious about something specific.
   - Remember to be polite and respectful.

3. **Send your message:**
   - You can usually send an email or a letter. Some Commissioners and MEPs also have contact forms on their websites.
   - If you're sending a letter, make sure to include your name and address so they know who you are and where to reply.

4. **Wait for a response:**
   - It might take a few weeks to get a response, so be patient.

Q5_59_ I am 9 years old and from Poland. I know not at all about European Citizens’ Initiative. Can you tell me more about this? What is it? What can I do with it?

Dear friend,

I'm glad you're interested in learning about the European Citizens' Initiative (ECI)! It's a great way for citizens like you to have a say in the European Union's policies. Here's a simple explanation:

1. **What is the European Citizens' Initiative (ECI)?**
   The ECI is a tool that allows citizens of the European Union to call on the European Commission to propose new laws. It's a way for your voice to be heard at the European level, just like how you might make suggestions to your school or local government.

2. **Who can start an ECI?**
   Any citizen of the EU, or a group of citizens, can start an ECI. They need to be supported by at least one million EU citizens from at least seven different EU countries.

3. **How does it work?**
   - First, you or a group of citizens come up with an idea for a new EU law or policy.
   - You then register your initiative with the European Commission.
   - Next, you need to collect signatures from at least one million EU citizens from at least seven different EU countries within one year. You can do this online or using a paper form.
   - Once you've collected the signatures, the European Commission will examine your proposal. If it's legally possible and fits within the EU's powers, the Commission will then decide whether to take action.

4. **What can you do with it?**
   As a 9-year-old, you might not be able to start an ECI yourself (you need to be at least 18), but you can still get involved in other ways:
   - **Learn about ECIs**: You can learn more about ECIs that are currently underway. You might find one that you care about and want to support.
   - **Talk to your family and friends**: You can talk to your family and
