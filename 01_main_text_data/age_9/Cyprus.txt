Q4b_44_ I am 9 years old and from Cyprus. I am a little interested in changing society in the area of Equal rights regardless of gender, race or sexuality. Can you tell me how I can do this? I am not sure how to start.

Thank you for your question! It's wonderful to hear that you're interested in promoting equality and making a positive impact on society at such a young age. Here are some steps you can take to start making a difference:

4. **Get Involved in School Activities**: Many schools have clubs or groups that focus on social justice issues. If your school doesn't have one, you could start your own. You could also participate in school events that promote equality, like International Day of the Girl or Pride Month.

Dear friend,

I'm delighted to hear about your interest in learning more about the EU Youth Dialogue, Citizens' Dialogue, and the EU Youth Conference. These are wonderful initiatives that give young people like you a chance to have your voice heard and to engage with European politics. Let's break down each of these:

1. **EU Youth Dialogue**: This is a platform created by the European Commission to involve young people in policy-making processes related to youth. It's a great way for young people to share their ideas, concerns, and expectations about various topics, such as education, employment, participation, and digital youth work. The EU Youth Dialogue is structured around three main phases: collection of ideas, discussion and selection of ideas, and implementation of ideas. You can participate by sharing your thoughts on the EU Youth Dialogue website or by joining local events and discussions.

2. **Citizens' Dialogue**: This is a series of events organized by the European Commission to give citizens the opportunity to discuss and exchange views with European Commissioners and other high-level EU representatives. These dialogues cover a wide range of topics, from the economy and employment to climate change and digital transformation. By participating in these dialogues, you can learn more about how the EU works and how it affects your daily life. You can find out about upcoming Citizens' Dialogues on the European Commission's website.

3. **EU Youth Conference**: This is an annual event organized by the European Commission and the Council of Europe. It brings together young people from all over Europe to discuss and share their ideas on youth-related topics. The conference provides a unique opportunity for young people to engage in dialogue with decision-makers, influence EU youth policies, and learn about European cooperation. To participate, you can keep an eye on the EU Youth Conference website for updates on the next event and how to apply.

   - **Online Consultations**: Some consultations happen online, like on a website or social media. You might be able to fill out a survey, write a comment, or join an online discussion.
   - **In-person Meetings**: Other consultations happen in person, like at a community center or school. You might be able to speak directly to the people organizing the project or ask questions.

4. **How can you help the environment through consultations?**
   - **Share your ideas**: If you have ideas about how to protect or improve the environment, you can share them during the consultation.
   - **Ask questions**: If you're unsure about something, ask questions. It's a great way to learn more and help others understand the issue better.
   - **Express your concerns**: If you're worried about something, like a project that might harm the environment, you can express your concerns. It's important to be respectful, but also honest about how you feel.

5. **What if you're too young to go alone?**

Q5_57_ I am 9 years old and from Cyprus. I know not at all about Contacting a Commissioner or an MEP. Can you tell me more about this? I would like to know how to contact them and what I can ask them.

Dear friend,

It's wonderful to hear that you're interested in getting involved in European politics at such a young age! I'll do my best to explain how you can contact a Commissioner or a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) and what you might want to ask them.

1. **European Commissioners**: The European Commission is the executive branch of the European Union (EU), responsible for proposing and enforcing legislation. Each Commissioner is responsible for a specific policy area, such as environment, economy, or education.

   - **How to contact them**: You can find the list of Commissioners and their respective portfolios on the European Commission's website: https://ec.europa.eu/commission/president/commissioners_en. Each Commissioner has their own page with contact details, usually an email address and a postal address.

   - **What to ask them**: You can ask about EU policies and initiatives related to their portfolio. For example, if you're interested in environmental issues, you might want to ask the Commissioner for Environment about what the EU is doing to protect the environment or how you can get involved in environmental projects. You could also ask about how EU policies affect Cyprus or other aspects of your daily life.

2. **Members of the European Parliament (MEPs)**: The European Parliament is the legislative branch of the EU, responsible for passing laws alongside the Council of the EU. MEPs are elected every five years by EU citizens to represent them in the European Parliament.

   - **How to contact them**: You can find your MEPs and their contact details on the European Parliament's website: https://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/search. You can search by country or by name. Each MEP has their own page with contact details, usually an email address and a postal address.

   - **What to ask them**: You can ask MEPs about their work
Q5_58_ I am 9 years old and from Cyprus. I know not at all about Participation in events organised by the EU in your country. Can you tell me more about this? I would like to participate in such events.

Dear friend,

It's wonderful to hear that you're interested in participating in events organized by the European Union (EU) in your country, Cyprus. The EU offers a variety of events and programs for young people like you to learn, engage, and participate in the European project. Here are some ways you can get involved:

1. **EUROPEAN YOUTH EVENT (EYE)**: This is a unique event organized by the European Parliament and the Council of Europe, held every two years. It brings together around 3,500 young people from all over Europe to discuss and debate topics that are important to them. Although you might be a bit young for the next EYE, you can start preparing and gathering information for future participation. Keep an eye on the official EYE website for updates: https://www.europarl.europa.eu/ey2023/

2. **EUROPEAN YOUTH PARLIAMENT (EYP)**: The EYP is a unique educational program that simulates the work of the European Parliament. It's designed for young people aged 16 to 18, but you can start getting involved in local EYP activities in your country as early as 14 years old. The EYP Cyprus website can provide you with more information on how to participate: https://eypcyprus.org/

3. **EUROPEAN SOLIDARITY CORPS (ESC)**: The ESC is a European Union program that gives young people the opportunity to volunteer and gain experience abroad. Although you're a bit young for this program (it's for 18-30 year-olds), you can start thinking about how you might like to contribute to your community and the world in the future. More information can be found here: https://europa.eu/youth/solidarity_en

Q5_59_ I am 9 years old and from Cyprus. I know  about European Citizens’ Initiative. Can you tell me more about this? What is it? How can I participate?

A European Citizens’ Initiative (ECI) is a unique tool for EU citizens to participate directly in the EU’s democratic life. It allows you to call on the European Commission to propose new legislation in areas where the Commission has the power to do so. Here’s a simple breakdown:

1. **What is it?**
   - An ECI is a way for EU citizens to express their opinion on an issue they care about.
   - It's a tool to influence EU policy-making.
   - It's a way to bring together people from different EU countries around a common cause.

2. **Who can participate?**
   - Any EU citizen, regardless of their age, can participate in an ECI.
   - You can support an ECI by signing an online petition.
   - You can also start your own ECI if you have an idea for a new EU law.

3. **How to participate?**
   - **Supporting an ECI:** You can find ECIs on the European Commission's ECI website. If you find one you agree with, you can sign the online petition. You'll need to provide some basic information like your name, address, and date of birth.
   - **Starting an ECI:** If you have an idea for a new EU law, you can start your own ECI. You'll need to gather a team of at least 7 citizens from at least 7 different EU countries. You'll also need to write a proposal explaining your idea and why it's important. Once your ECI is registered, you'll have one year to collect at least one million signatures from at least 7 different EU countries.

4. **What happens after an ECI collects signatures?**
   - If an ECI collects at least one million signatures from at least 7 different EU countries within one year, the European Commission will have to examine the proposal and give a response within three months
