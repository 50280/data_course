Dear friend,

It's wonderful to hear that you're interested in getting involved in your community and helping others. At your age, there are many ways you can start participating in democratic processes and making a positive impact. Here are some suggestions:

Q5_51_ I am 9 years old and from Romania. I know not at all about Citizens’ dialogue, EU Youth Dialogue or EU Youth Conference. Can you tell me more about this? I am very curious to learn more about this.

Dear friend,

I'm delighted to help you understand these important initiatives! Let's break them down into simpler parts:

1. **Citizens' Dialogue**: This is a way for European citizens to talk directly with members of the European Commission. It's like a big conversation where you can ask questions, share your ideas, and learn about what the EU is doing. These dialogues happen all over Europe, and they're a great way to have your voice heard. You can ask about anything that's important to you, like education, environment, or even your favorite hobby!

2. **EU Youth Dialogue**: This is a special conversation just for young people like you! It's a way for the EU to listen to what young people think and want. You can share your ideas about things that matter to you, like education, jobs, or how to make the world a better place. The EU Youth Dialogue happens every year, and it's a great opportunity to make your voice heard and help shape the future of Europe.

3. **EU Youth Conference**: This is a big event where young people from all over Europe come together to talk about the EU Youth Dialogue and its results. It's a chance to meet other young people from different countries, learn about their cultures, and work together to make a difference. The EU Youth Conference happens every year, and it's a fantastic way to connect with other young Europeans and be part of something big.

These initiatives are all about giving young people a say in what happens in Europe. They're a way for you to have your voice heard, learn about what's going on, and make new friends from all over the continent. Isn't that cool?

If you're interested in getting involved, you can start by talking to your parents, teachers, or other adults you trust. They can help you find out more about these initiatives and how you can take part. You can also check out

Q5_53_ I am 9 years old and from Romania. I know kind of about European elections. Can you tell me more about this? What are they and how do they work?

Dear friend,

I'm delighted to help you understand the European elections! Here's a simple explanation:

1. **What are European Elections?**
   European elections are like a big vote where people from many countries in Europe choose who will represent them in the European Parliament. The European Parliament is like the assembly of the European Union (EU), which is a group of 27 countries that work together on many things like trade, laws, and cooperation.

2. **Why are they important?**
   The European Parliament makes laws that affect the lives of people in the EU. For example, they can decide on rules about the environment, consumer rights, or how to deal with big problems like the COVID-19 pandemic. So, these elections are a chance for you and other Europeans to have a say in how these things are decided.

3. **How do they work?**
   - **Voting:** In each EU country, people who are old enough to vote (usually 18 or 19 years old) can vote for a list of candidates from different political parties. Some countries also have a system where you can vote for individual candidates.
   - **MEPs:** The people who get the most votes become Members of the European Parliament (MEPs). There are 705 MEPs in total, and they come from all the EU countries.
   - **Elections:** European elections happen every 5 years. The next ones will be in 2024.

4. **What can I do?**
   Even though you're not old enough to vote yet, you can still learn about the different political parties and their ideas. You can talk to your family, teachers, or friends about what you've learned. When you're older, you'll be able to vote and have a direct say in who represents you in the European Parliament.

5. **Fun fact:** The European Parliament is one of

Q5_55_ I am 9 years old and from Romania. I know not at all about Visit of the EU institutions. Can you tell me more about this? Thank you.

Hello! I'm glad to help you learn about the European Union (EU) and its institutions. The EU is a political and economic union of 27 member states that are primarily located in Europe. It has several institutions that help it function and make decisions. Here are some of the main ones:

1. **European Parliament**: This is the legislative branch of the EU, similar to a parliament in a country. It has 705 members who are elected every five years by EU citizens. They represent the people of Europe and make laws for the EU. The European Parliament is based in Strasbourg, France.

2. **Council of the European Union**: Also known as the "Council," this institution represents the governments of the EU member states. It has one representative from each country, usually a minister. The Council makes decisions on behalf of the EU, often together with the European Parliament.

3. **European Commission**: This is the executive branch of the EU. It proposes new laws, runs the day-to-day business of the EU, and makes sure that EU laws are enforced. The Commission has 27 members, one from each member state. They are appointed by the governments of the member states and must be approved by the European Parliament. The Commission is based in Brussels, Belgium.

4. **European Council**: This is not to be confused with the Council of the European Union. The European Council provides the EU with the necessary impetus for its development and defines the general political guidelines. It's composed of the heads of state or government of the member states, along with the President of the European Commission and the President of the European Council.

5. **European Court of Justice**: This court interprets EU law to make sure it's applied in the same way in all EU countries. It also settles disputes between EU institutions, between EU countries, and between EU countries and EU institutions.

Q5_58_ I am 9 years old and from Romania. I know not at all about Participation in events organised by the EU in your country. Can you tell me more about this? I would like to participate in such events.

Dear friend,

It's wonderful to hear that you're interested in participating in events organized by the European Union (EU) in your country, Romania. The EU offers a variety of events and initiatives that are designed to engage citizens, especially young people, in the democratic process and to promote European values and ideals. Here are some ways you can participate:

1. **EU Information Days and Weeks**: The EU Delegation to Romania often organizes information days and weeks dedicated to various EU themes, such as the EU's budget, its policies on environment, research, or youth. These events usually include workshops, debates, and interactive activities. You can find information about these events on the EU Delegation's website or social media channels.

2. **EU Youth Dialogue**: This is a platform for young people to express their views and ideas on issues that matter to them. The EU Youth Dialogue is organized in Romania by the Ministry of Youth and Sport, in cooperation with the EU Delegation. It's a great opportunity for you to have your voice heard and to engage with other young people from Romania and across Europe. You can find more information on the Ministry's website.

3. **EU-funded Projects**: Many organizations in Romania receive EU funding to implement projects that benefit young people, such as educational programs, cultural exchanges, or environmental initiatives. These projects often involve young people as active participants. You can look for such projects on the websites of organizations working in areas that interest you.

4. **EU Competitions and Contests**: The EU organizes various competitions and contests for young people, such as the EU's "Europe for Citizens" program, which includes a contest for schools called "My Europe". These competitions are a great way to learn more about the EU and to express your creativity and ideas.

Q5_59_ I am 9 years old and from Romania. I know not at all about European Citizens’ Initiative. Can you tell me more about this? What is it? What can I do with it?

Hello! It's great to hear that you're interested in learning about the European Citizens’ Initiative (ECI). I'll explain it in a simple way so that it's easy for you to understand.

The European Citizens’ Initiative is a way for citizens of the European Union (EU) to directly influence the EU's agenda. It's like a petition, but it's special because if a lot of people sign it, the European Commission has to consider it and might even propose a new law.

Here's how it works:

1. **Anyone can start an ECI**: You need to be a citizen of an EU country, and you need to gather a group of at least 7 other citizens from at least 7 different EU countries to support your idea.

2. **The idea must be about something the EU can do**: This could be about the environment, consumer protection, public health, or many other things. It can't be about things that are decided by individual countries, like taxes or education.

3. **Gather signatures**: Once your ECI is registered, you have one year to gather at least 1 million signatures from EU citizens. These signatures must come from at least 7 different EU countries, and each country has a target number of signatures based on its population.

4. **The European Commission considers the ECI**: If you gather enough signatures, the European Commission will consider your idea. They might decide to propose a new law, or they might explain why they don't think a new law is needed.

As a 9-year-old, you might not be able to start an ECI yourself, but you can certainly help! You can talk to your parents, teachers, and friends about issues you care about. You can also help gather signatures if there's an ECI you believe in.

Here are a few ECIs that kids might be interested in:
