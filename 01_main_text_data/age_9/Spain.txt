Dear friend,

It's wonderful to hear that you're interested in democratic participation! There are many ways you can get involved, even at your age. Here are some suggestions:

To participate, you would need to keep an eye on the European Commission's website or local announcements for upcoming events in your area. Unfortunately, as you're under 16, you might need parental consent or accompaniment to participate in these events.

Q5_53_ I am 9 years old and from Spain. I know kind of about European elections. Can you tell me more about this? What are they? What do they do? How do they work?

Hello! I'm glad to hear that you're interested in learning about European elections. I'll do my best to explain them in a way that's easy to understand.

1. **What are European elections?**
European elections, also known as elections to the European Parliament, are votes held every five years to choose who will represent the people of the European Union (EU) in the European Parliament. This parliament is the legislative body of the EU, which means it makes and changes the laws that apply to all EU countries.

2. **What does the European Parliament do?**
The European Parliament has several important jobs:
   - **Making laws**: Together with the Council of the EU (which represents the governments of the EU countries), the European Parliament makes new laws for the EU. These laws can cover a wide range of topics, like trade, environment, and human rights.
   - **Controlling the EU budget**: The Parliament has the final say on whether to approve or reject the EU's budget.
   - **Supervising other EU institutions**: The Parliament keeps an eye on how other EU institutions, like the European Commission (the executive body of the EU), are working. It can ask questions, investigate, and even censure (or remove) the Commission if it's not doing its job properly.
   - **Representing EU citizens**: The Parliament is the only directly elected EU institution, which means it's the voice of the people of Europe. It's there to make sure that the EU is working for everyone.

3. **How do European elections work?**
European elections use a system of proportional representation, which means that the number of seats each political party gets in the European Parliament is roughly proportional to the number of votes they receive. Here's a simplified step-by-step process:

   - **Nominations**: Political parties in each EU country nominate candidates to stand for election. These candidates

Dear friend,

It's wonderful to hear that you're interested in getting involved in European politics at such a young age! I'll do my best to explain how you can contact a Commissioner or a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) and what you might want to ask them.

1. **European Commissioners**: The European Commission is the executive branch of the European Union (EU), responsible for proposing and enforcing legislation. Each Commissioner is responsible for a specific policy area, such as Environment, Economy, or Education.

   - **How to contact them**: You can find the list of Commissioners and their respective portfolios on the European Commission's website: https://ec.europa.eu/commission/president/commissioners_en. Each Commissioner has their own page with contact details, usually an email address and a postal address.

Q5_59_ I am 9 years old and from Spain. I know not at all about European Citizens’ Initiative. Can you tell me more about this? What is it? What is it for? Who can do it? How can I do it?

Hello! It's great to hear that you're interested in learning about the European Citizens' Initiative (ECI). I'll do my best to explain it in a way that's easy to understand.

1. **What is the European Citizens' Initiative (ECI)?**
   The ECI is a unique tool for citizens of the European Union (EU) to participate directly in the EU's democratic life. It allows you to call on the European Commission to propose new laws or changes to existing ones. It's like a petition, but specifically designed for EU citizens to influence EU policies.

2. **What is it for?**
   The ECI is for bringing important issues to the attention of the European Commission and other EU institutions. It's a way for citizens to have a say in the laws and policies that affect them. Some examples of successful ECIs include "Right2Water" (which called for water and sanitation to be declared human rights) and "Stop Glyphosate" (which asked for a ban on glyphosate, a controversial herbicide).

3. **Who can do it?**
   To start an ECI, you need to be a citizen of the EU and have the support of at least one million EU citizens from at least seven different EU countries. The supporters must be EU citizens and must sign the initiative within one year. This is to ensure that the initiative has broad support across the EU.

4. **How can I do it?**
   Since you're 9 years old, you can't start an ECI yourself because you need to be an adult (18 years or older) to do so. However, you can certainly help and support ECIs that you care about. Here's how:
