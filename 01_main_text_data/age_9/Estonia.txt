1. **Write Letters or Emails**: You can write letters or emails to your local representatives, politicians, or even the president. Share your thoughts, concerns, and ideas about issues that matter to you. You can also write to companies to express your opinions about their products, services, or environmental practices.

2. **Start a Blog or Vlog**: If you're comfortable with technology, you can start a blog or a YouTube channel to share your thoughts and ideas with a wider audience. This can be a great way to raise awareness about issues you care about.

1. **Write a Letter to the Editor**: Many newspapers and magazines allow readers to submit letters to the editor. This is a great way to share your thoughts and opinions on current events with a wider audience. You can also write to local newspapers to discuss issues that affect your community.

2. **Start a Petition**: Websites like Change.org make it easy for anyone to start a petition on an issue they care about. You can share your petition with friends, family, and on social media to gather signatures and raise awareness.

Thank you for your question. It's wonderful to see that you're already thinking about how to make a positive impact on the world at such a young age. Here are some ways you can help the environment and animals:

2. **Reduce, Reuse, Recycle**: Practice the three R's in your daily life. Reduce waste by using reusable bags, bottles, and containers. Reuse items as much as possible, and recycle what you can't reuse.

3. **Plant Trees**: Trees absorb carbon dioxide, which helps combat climate change. You can plant trees in your backyard, a local park, or participate in a community tree-planting event.

4. **Conserve Water**: Turn off the tap while brushing your teeth or washing your hands. Fix any leaks in your home. Collect rainwater to water your plants.

5. **Save Energy**: Turn off lights and electronics when you're not using them. Use energy-efficient light bulbs. Consider using public transportation, carpooling, or riding a bike instead of driving to reduce your carbon footprint.

6. **Protect Wildlife**: Create a safe space for wildlife in your backyard by installing bird feeders, birdhouses, or bat boxes. Never litter, as it can harm or kill wildlife.

7. **Adopt, Don't Shop**: If you're thinking about getting a pet, consider adopting from a shelter instead of buying from a pet store. This helps reduce the demand for puppy mills and gives a home to an animal in need.

These dialogues can happen in many forms, like public events, online discussions, or even through written contributions.

Q5_57_ I am 9 years old and from Estonia. I know not at all about Contacting a Commissioner or an MEP. Can you tell me more about this? I would like to know how to contact them and what I can ask them.

Dear friend,

It's wonderful to hear that you're interested in getting involved in European politics at such a young age! I'll do my best to explain how you can contact a Commissioner or a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) and what you might want to ask them.

1. **European Commissioners**: The European Commission is the executive branch of the European Union (EU), responsible for proposing and enforcing legislation. Each Commissioner is responsible for a specific policy area, such as environment, economy, or digital affairs.

   - **How to contact them**: You can find the list of Commissioners and their respective portfolios on the European Commission's website: https://ec.europa.eu/commission/president/commissioners_en. Each Commissioner has their own page with contact details, usually an email address and a postal address. You can also reach out to them via social media, as many Commissioners are active on platforms like Twitter and Facebook.

   - **What to ask them**: You can ask about any EU-related topic that falls under their portfolio. For example, if you're interested in climate change, you might want to contact the Commissioner for Climate Action and Energy. You could ask about the EU's climate goals, policies, or how the EU is helping other countries tackle climate change. Remember to be clear, respectful, and concise in your communication.

2. **Members of the European Parliament (MEPs)**: The European Parliament is the legislative branch of the EU, responsible for passing laws alongside the Council of the EU. MEPs are elected every five years by EU citizens to represent them at the European level.

   - **How to contact them**: You can find your local MEPs and their contact details on the European Parliament's website: https://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/search. You can also find MEPs on social media. Some MEPs have

Q5_59_ I am 9 years old and from Estonia. I know not at all about European Citizens’ Initiative. Can you tell me more about this? What is it? What can I do with it?

Dear friend,

I'm glad you're interested in learning about the European Citizens' Initiative (ECI)! It's a great way for citizens like you to have a say in the European Union's policies. Here's a simple explanation:

1. **What is the European Citizens' Initiative (ECI)?**
   The ECI is a tool that allows citizens of the European Union to call on the European Commission to propose new laws. It's a way for your voice to be heard at the European level, just like how you might make suggestions to your school or local government.

2. **Who can start an ECI?**
   Any citizen of the EU, or a group of citizens, can start an ECI. They need to collect signatures from at least one million EU citizens from at least seven different EU countries.

3. **What can you do with it?**
   Even though you're not old enough to start an ECI yourself, you can still be a part of it in several ways:

   - **Learn about ECIs**: You can learn about ECIs that are currently underway. You might find one that you care about and want to support.

   - **Talk to your family and friends**: You can talk to your family and friends about ECIs. They might be interested in starting one or supporting one that you care about.

   - **Support ECIs**: When you're older, you'll be able to sign ECIs and help collect signatures. You can also help spread the word about ECIs on social media or by talking to people in your community.

   - **Become an ECI organizer**: When you're older, you might want to become an ECI organizer. This involves collecting signatures, talking to people, and helping to run an ECI campaign.

4. **How to find out more**:
   You can find out more about ECIs on the European Commission's website
