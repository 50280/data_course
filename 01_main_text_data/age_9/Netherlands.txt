4. **Join a club or group**: Joining a club or group that focuses on an issue you care about can be a great way to learn more and make a difference. This could be a sports team, a music group, or an environmental club. If your school doesn't have a club you're interested in, you could start one!

5. **Write letters or draw pictures**: You can write letters to your local government representatives, or draw pictures to express your opinions. This can be a fun and creative way to participate in democracy.

Q3_33_ I am 9 years old and from Netherlands. I have never taken part in activities that relate to democratic participation because These activities are too far away. It is difficult to get there from my home  (e.g. by public transport). For my friends, this is  the same. Can you tell me more about how I can do that? I would like to participate in activities that relate to democratic participation.

Dear friend,

It's wonderful to hear that you're interested in democratic participation at such a young age! There are indeed many ways you can get involved, even if you're not able to physically attend events due to distance or transportation issues. Here are some suggestions:

1. **Online Platforms**: Many organizations and governments offer online platforms where you can voice your opinion, suggest ideas, or participate in discussions. Some examples include:
   - Youth Voice: https://www.youthvoice.org/ (for young people in the UK)
   - Youth Participatory Politics Foundation: https://yppfoundation.org/ (for young people in the US)
   - European Youth Portal: https://europa.eu/youth/portal_en (for young people in Europe)

2. **Petitions and Online Campaigns**: Websites like Change.org allow you to start or sign petitions on issues you care about. You can also participate in online campaigns organized by non-profit organizations.

3. **Social Media**: Platforms like Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook can be used to raise awareness about issues and engage with politicians, organizations, and other young people. Remember to always be respectful and follow the platform's rules.

4. **School Activities**: You can start or join a school council or student union to discuss and implement changes in your school. You can also organize or participate in school events related to democracy and civic engagement.

5. **Local Youth Councils or Youth Parliaments**: Even if you can't attend meetings in person, some of these organizations might have online platforms or virtual meetings where you can participate. Check with your local municipality or council to see if this is an option.

6. **Write Letters or Emails**: You can write to your local representatives, ministers, or even the prime minister to express your views and ask questions. You can also write to newspapers or magazines to share your opinions.

Q4b_46_ I am 9 years old and from Netherlands. I am a little interested in changing society in the area of Wars and conflicts. Can you tell me how I can do this? I want to do something good for the world.

Dear friend,

It's wonderful to hear about your interest in making a positive impact on the world, especially at such a young age. Here are some steps you can take to start making a difference in the area of wars and conflicts:

1. **Educate Yourself**: Learn more about the causes and effects of wars and conflicts. Read books, watch documentaries, and talk to people who can help you understand these complex issues better. Some recommended books for your age group include "One World, Many Religions" by Mary Pope Osborne and "The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind" by William Kamkwamba.

2. **Spread Awareness**: Share what you've learned with your friends, family, and classmates. You can organize a presentation at your school, create a poster campaign, or start a blog to raise awareness about these issues.

3. **Fundraise**: You can organize fundraisers to support organizations that work to prevent conflicts and help those affected by them. This could be anything from a bake sale to a sponsored silence or a charity run. Some organizations you might consider supporting include UNICEF, Save the Children, or the International Rescue Committee.

4. **Write Letters**: Write letters to your local politicians, expressing your concerns about wars and conflicts. You can also write to newspapers or magazines to share your thoughts and ideas.

5. **Peace Education**: Learn about peace education and non-violent conflict resolution. You can use these skills in your own life and teach them to others. Organizations like the Peace Education Program can provide resources and guidance.

6. **Join a Club or Group**: Look for local clubs or groups that focus on peace and social justice. These can provide a supportive community and opportunities to take action.

7. **Start Small**: Remember, you don't have to change the world all at once. Start with small acts of kindness and compassion in your own community. This can help to create

Q5_51_ I am 9 years old and from Netherlands. I know not at all about Citizens’ dialogue, EU Youth Dialogue or EU Youth Conference. Can you tell me more about this? I am very curious about this.

Dear friend,

I'm delighted to hear about your interest in the EU Youth Dialogue and the Citizens' Dialogue! Let's break down these concepts into simpler parts so you can understand them better.

1. **EU (European Union)**: The EU is a group of 27 countries in Europe that work together to make decisions about many things, like trade, travel, and the environment. They have a common currency (the Euro), and people can move freely between the countries without needing a passport.

2. **Youth**: This refers to young people like you, who are between the ages of 13 and 30.

3. **Citizen**: A citizen is a person who lives in a country and has rights and responsibilities. In the EU, citizens can vote in elections, and they have the right to live, work, and study in any EU country.

Now, let's talk about the two dialogues you mentioned:

**EU Youth Dialogue**: This is a conversation between young people and EU decision-makers about topics that are important to young people. It's a way for young people to have a say in how the EU works and to help shape policies that affect them. Here's how it works:

- Young people from all over the EU come together to discuss and vote on topics they care about, like education, jobs, and the environment.
- The results of these discussions are shared with EU decision-makers, who then consider them when making policies.
- The EU Youth Dialogue happens every year, and it's a great way for young people to get involved in the EU and make their voices heard.

**Citizens' Dialogue**: This is a conversation between EU citizens and EU decision-makers about different topics. It's a way for citizens to share their thoughts and ideas about EU policies and to ask questions about how the EU works. Here's how it works:

- Citizens from all over the EU come together to discuss topics

Q5_55_ I am 9 years old and from Netherlands. I know not at all about Visit of the EU institutions. Can you tell me more about this? What is the EU? What are the EU institutions? What is the Visit of the EU institutions?

The EU, or European Union, is a group of 27 countries that work together to make decisions about many things, like trade, travel, and the environment. This helps them to cooperate and make life better for the people who live in these countries.

The EU has several institutions that help it to function and make decisions. Here are a few of the most important ones:

1. **European Parliament**: This is like the parliament of the EU. It's made up of elected members from each of the EU countries. They make laws and decide how the EU's money is spent.

2. **European Commission**: This is like the government of the EU. It proposes new laws and makes sure that the EU's rules are followed.

3. **Council of the European Union**: This is where representatives from each EU country meet to make decisions about the EU's policies.

4. **European Council**: This is where the heads of state or government of each EU country meet to set the EU's overall direction.

5. **European Court of Justice**: This is the EU's highest court. It makes sure that the EU's laws are followed and that they are interpreted correctly.

The "Visit of the EU institutions" could refer to a few things:

- **Educational Visits**: Many schools organize trips to Brussels, where the EU's main institutions are based, to teach students about how the EU works. Students can visit the European Parliament, the European Commission, and other institutions to learn more about the EU's decision-making process.

- **EU Open Days**: Every year, the EU institutions open their doors to the public for a few days. This is a chance for people to visit the institutions, learn about what they do, and even meet some of the people who work there.

- **EU Events**: The EU organizes many events throughout the year, like exhibitions,
Q5_56_ I am 9 years old and from Netherlands. I know not at all about The European Youth Week or the European Youth Event. Can you tell me more about this? I would like to know what it is, when it is and what I can do there.

The European Youth Week and the European Youth Event are initiatives of the European Parliament. They are both events that aim to bring young people together to discuss and share their ideas about Europe and its future.

The European Youth Week is a week-long event that takes place every year in May. It is organized by the European Parliament in cooperation with national parliaments and other partners. During the week, young people from all over Europe are invited to participate in various activities and events that are organized in their countries. These activities can include workshops, debates, and cultural events. The goal of the European Youth Week is to encourage young people to get involved in democratic processes and to learn more about the European Union and its institutions.

The European Youth Event (EYE) is a larger event that takes place every two years in the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France. It is a unique opportunity for young people from all over Europe to come together and share their ideas and opinions about Europe's future. During the event, young people can participate in workshops, debates, and other activities that are organized by the European Parliament and its partners. They can also meet with Members of the European Parliament and other decision-makers to discuss their ideas and concerns.

Both the European Youth Week and the European Youth Event are open to young people aged 16-30. If you are interested in participating in these events, you can find more information and register on the European Parliament's website. You can also contact your national parliament or other local organizations that work with young people to find out if they are organizing any activities or events related to the European Youth Week or the European Youth Event.

Q5_58_ I am 9 years old and from Netherlands. I know not at all about Participation in events organised by the EU in your country. Can you tell me more about this? I am very interested in this.

Participation in events organised by the EU in your country can be a great way to learn more about the European Union, its values, and how it works. Here are some ways you can participate:

1. **EU Open House Day**: This is an annual event where EU institutions and agencies open their doors to the public. You can visit these places, learn about what they do, and even meet people who work there. It's a great opportunity to see how the EU works from the inside.

2. **EU Information Days**: These are events organised by the EU Delegation in your country to provide information about EU policies, programmes, and funding opportunities. They often include workshops, presentations, and Q&A sessions.

3. **EU Film Festivals**: The EU organises film festivals to showcase European cinema and culture. These can be a fun way to learn about different European countries and their cultures.

4. **EU Youth Dialogue**: This is a platform for young people to have their say on issues that matter to them. It's a great way to get involved in decision-making processes and make your voice heard.

5. **EU Competitions and Contests**: The EU often organises competitions and contests for young people, such as the EU's "Europe for Citizens" programme. These can be a fun way to learn about the EU and its values.

6. **EU Study Visits**: These are trips organised for young people to visit EU institutions and learn about how they work. They can be a great way to see the EU in action.

To find out about these events, you can check the website of the EU Delegation in your country. They usually have a calendar of events and information about how to participate. You can also follow them on social media to stay up-to-date.

Q5_59_ I am 9 years old and from Netherlands. I know not at all about European Citizens’ Initiative. Can you tell me more about this? What is it? What can I do with it?

Dear friend,

I'm glad you're interested in learning about the European Citizens' Initiative (ECI)! It's a great way for citizens like you to have a say in the European Union's policies. Here's a simple explanation:

1. **What is the European Citizens' Initiative (ECI)?**
   The ECI is a tool that allows citizens of the European Union to call on the European Commission to propose new laws. It's a way for your voice to be heard at the European level, just like how you can make suggestions to your local government.

2. **How does it work?**
   - To start an ECI, you need to be a citizen of an EU country and have at least 7 European citizens from at least 7 different EU countries support your idea.
   - Once you have this support, you need to collect at least 1 million signatures from EU citizens within 12 months. These signatures can come from any EU country, but each country has a minimum number of signatures that must be collected.
   - If you reach this target, the European Commission will consider your proposal and decide whether to take action.

3. **What can you do with it?**
   - **Learn about EU policies**: The ECI is a great way to learn about different topics and policies that affect Europe and its citizens.
   - **Share your ideas**: If you have an idea for a new law or policy, you can start an ECI and try to gather support for it.
   - **Support others' ideas**: You can also support other people's ECIs by signing them if you agree with their ideas.
   - **Participate in democracy**: By taking part in the ECI, you're helping to make the EU more democratic and showing that citizens can have a say in how it's run.

4. **Can you sign an ECI?**
   - Since you're
