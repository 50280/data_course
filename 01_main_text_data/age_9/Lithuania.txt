Q5_51_ I am 9 years old and from Lithuania. I know not at all about Citizens’ dialogue, EU Youth Dialogue or EU Youth Conference. Can you tell me more about this? I am very interested in this topic.

Dear friend,

I'm delighted to hear about your interest in the EU Youth Dialogue and the Citizens' Dialogue! Let's break down these topics into simpler parts to help you understand them better.

1. **EU (European Union)**: The EU is a group of 27 countries in Europe that work together to make decisions about many aspects of life, like trade, travel, and environmental protection. This includes your country, Lithuania.

2. **Citizens' Dialogue**: Imagine you're having a conversation with your friends about something you all care about, like your favorite game or a book you've read. Now, imagine that conversation happening on a larger scale, with people from different countries, and the topic is about how to make the EU a better place. That's what a Citizens' Dialogue is! It's a way for EU citizens to share their ideas and concerns with each other and with EU leaders. These dialogues can happen in many forms, like public events, online discussions, or even through written contributions.

3. **EU Youth Dialogue**: The EU Youth Dialogue is a special part of the Citizens' Dialogue, focused on young people like you. It's a way for the EU to listen to young people's ideas and opinions about how to make Europe a better place for young people to live, work, and study. The EU Youth Dialogue happens in several steps:

   - **EU Youth Conferences**: These are big events where young people from all over the EU come together to discuss and vote on the most important topics for young people. The results of these conferences are then shared with EU leaders to help them make decisions.

   - **National Youth Panels**: In each EU country, there are groups of young people who meet regularly to discuss and vote on the same topics as the EU Youth Conferences. These national panels help make sure that the voices of young people from all over the EU are heard.

Q5_59_ I am 9 years old and from Lithuania. I know not at all about European Citizens’ Initiative. Can you tell me more about this? What is it? What can I do with it?

Dear friend,

I'm glad you're interested in learning about the European Citizens' Initiative (ECI)! It's a great way for citizens like you to have a say in the European Union's policies. Here's a simple explanation:

1. **What is the European Citizens' Initiative (ECI)?**
   The ECI is a tool that allows citizens of the European Union to call on the European Commission to propose new laws. It's a way for your voice to be heard at the European level, just like how you might make suggestions to your school or local government.

2. **Who can start an ECI?**
   Any citizen of the EU, or a group of citizens, can start an ECI. They need to be supported by at least one million EU citizens from at least seven different EU countries.

3. **What can you do with it?**
   Even though you're 9 years old, you can still participate and support ECIs! Here's how:

   - **Learn about ongoing ECIs**: You can visit the European Commission's ECI website (https://ec.europa.eu/citizens-initiative/public/welcome.do) to see what initiatives are currently underway. You might find topics that you care about, like protecting the environment, helping animals, or promoting education.

   - **Support ECIs**: If you find an ECI that you agree with, you can support it. To do this, you'll need to provide some basic information, like your name, age, and address. Remember, you need to be at least 18 years old to support an ECI.

   - **Spread the word**: You can also help by telling your family, friends, and classmates about ECIs you care about. The more people who know about them, the more likely they are to succeed.

   - **Start your own ECI (in the future)**: When you're
