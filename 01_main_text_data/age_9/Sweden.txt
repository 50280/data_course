Q4b_41_ I am 9 years old and from Sweden. I am a little interested in changing society in the area of Climate change and environmental protection. Can you tell me how I can do this? I want to do something that is not too big, but still makes a difference.

Hello! It's wonderful to hear that you're interested in making a difference in the area of climate change and environmental protection at such a young age. Here are some ideas that you can do, which are not too big but can still make a significant impact:

1. **Educate Yourself and Others**: Learn more about climate change and environmental issues. Share what you've learned with your friends, family, and classmates. You can start a small club or group at your school to discuss these topics and come up with ideas together.

2. **Reduce, Reuse, Recycle**: Make sure you're doing your part in reducing waste. Bring a reusable bag when you go shopping, use a reusable water bottle instead of buying plastic ones, and recycle paper, plastic, and glass according to your local recycling guidelines.

3. **Plant Trees**: Trees absorb carbon dioxide, so planting more of them can help reduce the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. You could start a small garden at your school or in your community.

4. **Save Energy**: Turn off lights and electronics when you're not using them. Use energy-efficient light bulbs. Encourage your family to do the same.

5. **Conserve Water**: Turn off the tap while brushing your teeth or washing your hands. Fix any leaks in your home. Collect rainwater to water your plants.

7. **Protest and Advocate**: Join local protests or marches to raise awareness about climate change. Write letters to your local politicians to express your concerns and suggest solutions.

Q5_51_ I am 9 years old and from Sweden. I know not at all about Citizens’ dialogue, EU Youth Dialogue or EU Youth Conference. Can you tell me more about this? I am very interested in this.

Dear friend,

It's wonderful to hear that you're interested in learning more about the EU Youth Dialogue, Citizens' Dialogue, and the EU Youth Conference. I'm here to help explain these concepts in a way that's easy to understand!

1. **EU Youth Dialogue**: This is a platform created by the European Union (EU) to give young people a voice and a chance to influence EU policies that affect them. Here's a simple breakdown:

   - **Who can participate?** Young people aged 13 to 30 from EU member countries and other countries that are part of the EU's youth programs.
   - **What do we talk about?** Topics that matter to young people, such as education, employment, digital life, participation in democratic life, and more.
   - **How does it work?** Young people gather in local, national, and European events to discuss these topics and share their ideas. These ideas are then collected and sent to the European Commission, which can use them to shape EU policies.

2. **Citizens' Dialogue**: This is a series of events organized by the European Commission to give EU citizens the chance to discuss and share their views on EU policies and issues. Here's how it works:

   - **Who can participate?** Any EU citizen, regardless of age.
   - **What do we talk about?** Topics that affect EU citizens, such as the economy, environment, migration, and more. The topics change depending on what's most relevant at the time.
   - **How does it work?** Citizens gather in events across Europe to discuss these topics with each other and with EU officials. These discussions help the EU understand what citizens think and want, which can influence EU policies.

3. **EU Youth Conference**: This is a big event organized by the European Commission every year to bring together young people from across Europe to discuss and share their ideas on EU policies. Here's
Q5_52_ I am 9 years old and from Sweden. I know not at all about Public consultations. Can you tell me more about this? What is it?

A public consultation is a process where organizations, governments, or other bodies ask for people's opinions and ideas about something they are planning to do or change. This could be about a new law, a new service, a change in how something is done, or many other things. The main goal of a public consultation is to involve people in decision-making processes and to make sure that the final decision reflects the views and needs of the people who will be affected by it.

Here are some steps that usually happen in a public consultation:

1. **Information**: The organization or government explains what they want to do or change, why they want to do it, and how it might affect people.

2. **Asking for opinions**: They ask people for their thoughts, ideas, and concerns about the proposal. This can be done in many ways, such as through online surveys, public meetings, or written submissions.

3. **Listening**: The organization or government listens to what people have to say. They might also ask follow-up questions to better understand people's views.

4. **Considering feedback**: The organization or government considers the feedback they've received. They might change their plans based on what they've heard, or they might explain why they can't make certain changes.

5. **Sharing results**: After the consultation, the organization or government shares what they've heard and how they've used it. They might also share the final decision and explain why they made it.

Public consultations are important because they give people a chance to have a say in things that affect them. They can help make sure that decisions are fair, and that they take into account the needs and views of different people. However, it's also important that the people running the consultation listen carefully and use the feedback they receive in a fair and transparent way.

1. **European Commissioners**: The European Commission is the executive branch of the European Union (EU), responsible for proposing and enforcing legislation. Each Commissioner is responsible for a specific policy area, such as environment, economy, or education.

   - **How to contact them**: You can find the list of Commissioners and their respective portfolios on the European Commission's website: https://ec.europa.eu/commission/president/commissioners_en. Each Commissioner has their own page with contact details, usually an email address and a postal address. You can also reach out to them via social media, as many Commissioners have profiles on platforms like Twitter and Facebook.

   - **What to ask them about**: You can ask about any EU-related topic that falls under their portfolio. For example, if you're interested in climate change, you might want to contact the Commissioner for Climate Action and Energy. You could ask about the EU's climate goals, policies, or how the EU is helping other countries tackle climate change. Remember to be specific and clear in your questions.

2. **Members of the European Parliament (MEPs)**: The European Parliament is the legislative branch of the EU, responsible for passing laws alongside the Council of the EU. MEPs are elected every five years by EU citizens to represent them at the European level.

   - **How to contact them**: You can find your local MEPs and their contact details on the European Parliament's website: https://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/search. Simply enter your postcode or town to find your MEPs. You can usually contact
Q5_58_ I am 9 years old and from Sweden. I know not at all about Participation in events organised by the EU in your country. Can you tell me more about this? I am very interested in this.

Participation in events organised by the EU in your country can be a great way to learn more about the European Union, its policies, and its impact on your daily life. Here are some ways you can participate:

1. **EU Information Days and Events**: The EU often organises information days and events in member countries to explain its policies and initiatives. These can include exhibitions, workshops, and seminars. You can find out about these events through your local EU representation office, or by checking the EU's official website for your country.

2. **EU-funded Projects**: Many EU-funded projects involve local communities and offer opportunities for participation. These projects can range from environmental initiatives to cultural programmes. You can find out about these projects through your local EU representation office or by checking the EU's funding and tenders portal.

3. **EU Competitions and Contests**: The EU often organises competitions and contests for students and young people. These can be a fun way to learn about the EU and its values. For example, there's the EU's annual Euro Quiz for schools, and the European Youth Award for digital projects.

4. **EU Youth Dialogue**: The EU Youth Dialogue is a platform for young people to have their say on issues that matter to them. It's a great way to get involved in shaping EU policies. You can participate through your national youth council or other youth organisations.

5. **EU Elections**: When you're older, you'll have the opportunity to vote in EU elections. These elections are an important way to have your say on who represents you in the European Parliament, which is the EU's legislative body.

6. **EU Study Visits and Mobility Programmes**: If you're interested in learning more about other EU countries, you might be able to participate in study visits or mobility programmes. These can involve visiting other EU countries to learn about their culture, history, and educational systems.

Q5_59_ I am 9 years old and from Sweden. I know not at all about European Citizens’ Initiative. Can you tell me more about this? What is it?

A European Citizens’ Initiative (ECI) is a way for citizens of the European Union (EU) to directly influence the EU’s decision-making process. It allows a group of at least one million EU citizens from at least seven different EU countries to call on the European Commission to propose a legal act in a specific area. Here are some key points about the ECI:

1. **Who can participate?** Any EU citizen, or a group of EU citizens, can start an ECI. To sign an ECI, you must be an EU citizen and be registered in a EU country's civil registry or voters' list.

2. **What can an ECI be about?** An ECI can be about any area where the EU has the power to legislate, except for areas of exclusive member state competence, such as taxation, social security, and defense.

3. **How does it work?** To start an ECI, you need to submit a proposal to the European Commission. If the proposal is accepted, you have one year to collect at least one million signatures from at least seven different EU countries. Once you've collected the signatures, the European Commission will decide whether to take action. If the Commission decides not to act, it must explain why.

4. **What has been achieved?** So far, several ECIs have been successful in raising awareness about various issues and influencing EU policy. For example, the "Right2Water" ECI led to the EU recognizing water and sanitation as a human right.

5. **Why is it important?** The ECI gives EU citizens a direct say in EU policy-making, promoting democracy and transparency at the European level.
