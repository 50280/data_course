Q4b_44_ I am 9 years old and from Slovakia. I am a little interested in changing society in the area of Equal rights regardless of gender, race or sexuality. Can you tell me how I can do this? I want to do something good for the world.

2. **Talk to Others**: Discuss what you've learned with your family, friends, and classmates. Encourage them to think about equality and respect for all people. You can start conversations about why it's important to treat everyone fairly, regardless of their gender, race, or who they love.

3. **Stand Up for Others**: If you see someone being treated unfairly, find a safe way to stand up for them. This could be as simple as telling a teacher or another adult you trust, or it could mean speaking up in the moment if it's safe to do so. Always prioritize your safety first.

Q5_57_ I am 9 years old and from Slovakia. I know a lot about Contacting a Commissioner or an MEP. Can you tell me more about this? I want to know more about the European Parliament and how it works.

Dear young friend,

I'm delighted to hear about your interest in the European Parliament and its workings! It's fantastic that you're taking an active role in understanding how the EU operates. Let's break down the European Parliament and its processes into simpler parts for you.

1. **What is the European Parliament?**
The European Parliament is the legislative branch of the European Union (EU). It's like the parliament in your own country, but for the whole EU. It's made up of Members of the European Parliament (MEPs), who are elected every five years by EU citizens.

2. **Who are MEPs?**
MEPs are the elected representatives of EU citizens. They come from all 27 EU member countries and are responsible for passing EU laws, along with the Council of the EU. They also have the power to approve or reject the European Commission, which is the executive branch of the EU.

3. **How can I contact an MEP?**
You can contact an MEP to share your ideas, ask questions, or express concerns about EU policies. Here's how you can do it:

   - **Find your MEP**: First, you need to find out who your MEPs are. You can do this by visiting the European Parliament's website and using their "Find your MEP" tool. Since you're from Slovakia, you'll have 14 MEPs representing you.

   - **Contact details**: Once you've found your MEPs, you can find their contact details on the European Parliament's website. They usually provide an email address, postal address, and sometimes a phone number or social media profiles.

   - **Write a letter or email**: You can write a letter or email to your MEP. Be sure to include your name, age, and where you're from. Explain what you want to talk about in a clear and polite way. You can also

Q5_59_ I am 9 years old and from Slovakia. I know not at all about European Citizens’ Initiative. Can you tell me more about this? What is it? What can I do with it?

Hello! It's great to hear that you're interested in learning about the European Citizens’ Initiative (ECI). I'll explain it in a simple way so that it's easy for you to understand.

The European Citizens’ Initiative is a way for citizens of the European Union (EU) to directly influence the EU's policy-making process. It's like a petition, but it's special because it's designed to give EU citizens a voice in the EU's decision-making process.

Here's how it works:

1. **Who can start an ECI?** Any EU citizen, or a group of EU citizens, can start an ECI. They need to be at least 18 years old and have the support of at least one million EU citizens from at least seven different EU countries.

2. **What can you ask for?** You can ask the European Commission, which is the EU's executive body, to propose new laws or change existing ones. The request must fall within the EU's powers, meaning it's something the EU can legally do.

3. **How to start an ECI?** To start an ECI, you need to register it with the European Commission. You'll need to provide some information about your proposal, like what you're asking for and why. You'll also need to gather support from at least one million EU citizens. This is done online, using a special online collection system.

4. **What happens if an ECI is successful?** If an ECI gathers at least one million signatures, the European Commission has to examine the request and decide whether to propose new laws or change existing ones. They don't have to do what the ECI asks, but they have to explain why not.

As for what you can do with it, even though you're not 18 yet, you can still learn about ECIs and maybe even help with one. You could talk to your parents,
