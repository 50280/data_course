Q5_53_ I am 9 years old and from Portugal. I know kind of about European elections. Can you tell me more about this? What are they? What do they do? And how do they work?

Dear 9-year-old,

I'm delighted to help you understand the European elections! Let's break it down into simpler parts:

1. **What are European elections?**
   European elections are like a big vote where people from many different countries in Europe choose who will represent them in the European Parliament. The European Parliament is like the assembly of the European Union (EU), which is a group of 27 countries that work together on many things, like trade, travel, and environmental protection.

2. **What does the European Parliament do?**
   The European Parliament has several important jobs:
   - **Making laws**: Together with the Council of the EU (which represents the governments of the member countries), the European Parliament helps make new laws for the EU.
   - **Controlling the EU budget**: The Parliament decides whether to approve or reject the EU's budget.
   - **Supervising the European Commission**: The Commission is like the government of the EU. The Parliament keeps an eye on what the Commission is doing and can ask them to explain their actions.
   - **Representing EU citizens**: The Parliament makes sure that the voices of EU citizens are heard and that their rights are protected.

3. **How do European elections work?**
   - **Voting**: People who are EU citizens and live in an EU country can vote. They vote for political parties, not individual candidates. The parties then choose who will be their candidates for the European Parliament.
   - **Electoral system**: Each country has its own way of choosing how many members of the European Parliament it will have. Some countries use a system called proportional representation, where the number of seats a party gets is based on the percentage of votes they receive. Other countries use a system called first-past-the-post, where the candidate with the most votes in a particular area wins a seat.
   - **Election day**:

Q5_57_ I am 9 years old and from Portugal. I know a lot about Contacting a Commissioner or an MEP. Can you tell me more about this? I want to know more about the European Union and how it works.

Dear friend,

It's wonderful to hear about your interest in the European Union (EU) and its workings at such a young age! I'm here to help you understand more about how the EU functions and how you can engage with it.

The European Union is a political and economic union of 27 member states that are primarily located in Europe. It has several institutions that work together to make decisions and ensure the smooth running of the EU. Here are some key institutions and how you can interact with them:

1. **European Commission**: The Commission is the executive branch of the EU, responsible for proposing legislation and ensuring that EU laws are enforced. You can contact a Commissioner, who is in charge of a specific policy area, to share your ideas, concerns, or ask questions. Here's how:

   - Find the Commissioner responsible for the topic you're interested in: https://ec.europa.eu/commission/president/commissioners_en
   - Write a letter or send an email to their private office. You can find their contact details on the Commissioner's webpage.

2. **European Parliament**: The Parliament is the legislative branch of the EU, representing EU citizens and contributing to the creation of EU laws. You can contact an MEP (Member of the European Parliament) to share your views or ask questions. Here's how:

   - Find your MEP: https://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/search
   - Contact them via email, letter, or phone. You can find their contact details on their webpage.

3. **Council of the European Union**: The Council represents the governments of the EU member states and ensures that national perspectives are taken into account in EU decision-making. While it's not as easy to contact the Council directly as it is with the Commission or Parliament, you can still engage with your national government to express your views on EU matters.

Dear friend,

It's wonderful to hear that you're interested in participating in EU events in Portugal! The European Union (EU) organizes various events and initiatives across its member countries, including Portugal, to engage citizens, promote European values, and foster a sense of European identity. Here are some types of events and ways you can participate:

1. **EU Information Days and Citizens' Dialogues**: These events are organized by the European Commission's Representation in Portugal to inform citizens about EU policies, initiatives, and funding opportunities. They often include presentations, Q&A sessions, and discussions. To participate, keep an eye on the European Commission's Representation in Portugal website (<https://europa.eu/european-union/Countries_en>) for upcoming events and register when available.

2. **EU-funded Projects and Events**: Many EU-funded projects and events take place in Portugal, such as those related to research, education, culture, and youth. Some examples include:

Q5_59_ I am 9 years old and from Portugal. I know not at all about European Citizens’ Initiative. Can you tell me more about this? What is it? What can I do with it?

A European Citizens’ Initiative (ECI) is a unique tool for citizens of the European Union (EU) to participate directly in the EU’s democratic life. It allows you to call on the European Commission to propose new legislation in areas where the Commission has the power to do so. Here’s a simple breakdown:

1. **Who can participate?** Any EU citizen, or a group of EU citizens, can start or sign an ECI. You need to be a minimum of 18 years old. Since you’re 9, you can’t start or sign an ECI yet, but you can learn about it and maybe even help your parents or older siblings participate!

2. **What can you propose?** You can propose a new EU law or ask the Commission to take action in an area where it has the power to do so. The proposal must be related to one of the EU’s policy areas, like environment, energy, or human rights.

3. **How to start an ECI?** To start an ECI, you need to collect signatures from at least one million EU citizens from at least seven different EU countries. The signatures must be collected within one year. This is where you can help! You can talk to your family, friends, and neighbors about the ECI and encourage them to sign.

4. **What happens after an ECI is successful?** If an ECI collects one million signatures, the Commission will examine the proposal and decide whether to take action. If the Commission decides not to take action, it must explain why in a public hearing with the ECI organisers.

5. **How to sign an ECI?** If you find an ECI that you support, you can sign it online or on paper. To sign online, you need a valid ID document and to prove your nationality. If you’re too young to sign, you can still help by spreading the word!
