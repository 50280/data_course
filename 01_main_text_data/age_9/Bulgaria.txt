2. **School Activities**: Many schools have student councils or similar organizations where students can vote on issues that affect them, like school rules, events, or fundraisers. Ask your teacher or principal if there's something like this at your school. If not, maybe you could start one!

3. **Community Involvement**: Participate in local community events or initiatives. This could be anything from helping with a community clean-up day to attending a town hall meeting where local leaders discuss issues and plans for your area.

4. **Learn About Current Events**: Read age-appropriate news articles or watch news programs designed for kids. This can help you understand what's happening in your community, country, and the world. It can also give you ideas about issues you care about and want to get involved in.

6. **Join a Club or Group**: There might be clubs or groups in your community that focus on issues you care about, like protecting the environment or helping animals. Joining one of these can give you a chance to work with others to make a difference.

Q5_53_ I am 9 years old and from Bulgaria. I know a little about European elections. Can you tell me more about this? What are they and why are they important?

Dear 9-year-old,

I'm delighted to help you understand the European elections! Let's break it down into simpler parts:

1. **What are European elections?**
   Imagine you have a big school, and you want to choose some representatives to help make decisions for the whole school. These representatives will be part of a council that discusses and votes on important rules for the school. European elections are like that, but for a much bigger group of people - the countries in the European Union (EU).

   Every 5 years, the people of the EU countries vote for Members of the European Parliament (MEPs). These MEPs then go to the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France, to represent their countries and help make decisions for the EU.

2. **Why are they important?**
   European elections are important for several reasons:

   - **Making decisions together**: The EU is like a big club of countries that work together. The European Parliament helps make rules that affect many areas, like trade, travel, and even the environment. By voting, you're helping choose who will represent your country in these important discussions.

   - **Your voice matters**: When you vote, you're making your voice heard. You're telling the people you vote for what you think is important. This can help shape the decisions that are made.

   - **Learning about democracy**: Taking part in elections helps you learn about democracy - a system where people have a say in how they are governed. It's a great way to understand how your country and the EU work together.

   - **Choosing leaders**: The European Parliament also helps choose the President of the European Commission, which is like the head teacher of the EU school. So, by voting, you're helping choose who will lead the EU.

   - **Shaping the future**: The decisions made in the European Parliament can affect your life in many ways, like how you travel, what you

Q5_55_ I am 9 years old and from Bulgaria. I know not at all about Visit of the EU institutions. Can you tell me more about this? What is the EU? What are the EU institutions? What is the Visit of the EU institutions?

The EU, or European Union, is a group of 27 countries that work together to make decisions about many things, like trade, travel, and the environment. This helps them to cooperate and benefit from each other's strengths. The EU institutions are the bodies that make these decisions and ensure that the rules are followed. Here are the main EU institutions:

1. **European Parliament**: This is the only directly elected EU institution. It represents the people of Europe and has the power to pass laws and control the EU budget.

3. **European Commission**: This is the EU's executive body. It proposes new laws, runs the day-to-day business of the EU, and makes sure that EU laws are followed.

4. **European Council**: This is where the heads of state or government of the EU countries meet. They set the EU's political agenda and provide the general political directions and priorities.

5. **European Court of Justice**: This court makes sure that EU law is applied correctly and that the EU institutions act within their powers.

Q5_59_ I am 9 years old and from Bulgaria. I know not at all about European Citizens’ Initiative. Can you tell me more about this? What is it? What can I do with it?

Dear friend,

I'm glad you're interested in learning about the European Citizens' Initiative (ECI)! It's a great way for citizens like you to have a say in the European Union's policies. Here's a simple explanation:

1. **What is the European Citizens' Initiative (ECI)?**
   The ECI is a tool that allows citizens of the EU to call on the European Commission to propose new laws. It's a way for your voice to be heard at the European level. The ECI was introduced in 2012 to give EU citizens a direct say in the EU's decision-making process.

2. **How does it work?**
   - To start an ECI, you need to be a citizen of an EU country and have a proposal for a new EU law or policy.
   - You need to gather support from at least one million EU citizens from at least seven different EU countries. This is called the "one million signature threshold".
   - Once you've gathered the signatures, the European Commission will examine your proposal. If it's relevant for EU law and falls within the Commission's powers, they will have to respond to your proposal.

3. **What can you do with it?**
   - **Learn about EU policies**: The ECI is a great way to learn about different EU policies and how they affect your life.
   - **Get involved**: If there's an ECI that you care about, you can support it by signing the initiative or helping to collect signatures.
   - **Start your own ECI**: When you're older, you might want to start your own ECI if you have an idea for a new EU law or policy. This can help you learn about EU politics and how to make a difference.

4. **Why is it important?**
   The ECI is important because it gives EU citizens a direct say in the EU's decision-making
