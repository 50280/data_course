Once you're informed, share what you've learned with your friends, family, and community. You can start a club at school, create a blog, or make a presentation to your class.

2. **Write Letters or Emails**: Write to your local representatives, politicians, or even CEOs of companies you think could make a difference. Clearly explain your concerns and suggest solutions. You can also write letters to the editor of your local newspaper to share your opinions on current events.

3. **Start a Petition**: Websites like Change.org make it easy for anyone to start a petition. You can gather signatures from people who agree with your cause and submit it to the relevant authority.

4. **Volunteer**: Get involved with local charities or non-profit organizations that work on issues you care about. This could be anything from helping at an animal shelter to planting trees in your community.

6. **Create Art or Media**: Use your creativity to raise awareness about issues. This could be through drawing posters, writing poems or stories, making videos, or creating social media campaigns.

It's wonderful to hear that you're already thinking about how to make a difference in the world. You're right, contacting a politician is just one way to make your voice heard, and there are many other effective methods you can use. Here are some suggestions tailored to your age and abilities:

1. **Write Letters or Emails**: You can write letters or emails to local newspapers, magazines, or even directly to companies to express your opinions. You can also write to organizations that work on issues you care about, offering to volunteer or asking how you can help.

2. **Start a Petition**: Websites like Change.org allow anyone to start a petition on an issue they care about. You can start one on a topic that's important to you and share it with your friends and family to gather signatures.

3. **Plant Trees**: Trees absorb carbon dioxide, which helps combat climate change. You can plant trees in your backyard, a local park, or participate in a community tree-planting event.

4. **Conserve Water**: Turn off the tap while brushing your teeth, take shorter showers, and fix any leaks in your home to save water.

Q4b_45_ I am 9 years old and from Belgium. I am a little interested in changing society in the area of Human rights. Can you tell me how I can do this? I want to do something that is not too big, but still makes a difference. I want to do something that is not too big, but still makes a difference.

Here are some steps you can take to make a difference in the area of human rights, even at your age:

1. **Educate Yourself**: Learn about human rights, the issues surrounding them, and the people affected. This will help you understand what you're fighting for and how you can help. You can start by reading books, watching documentaries, or visiting reliable websites.

2. **Spread Awareness**: Share what you've learned with others. You can do this by:
   - Talking to your friends, family, and teachers about what you've learned.
   - Creating posters or flyers about human rights issues and putting them up in your school or community (with permission).
   - Using social media (with parental supervision) to share information and raise awareness.

3. **Fundraise**: You can organize small fundraisers to support organizations that work on human rights issues. This could be a bake sale, a car wash, or a sponsored event like a walk or a bike ride. Make sure to choose a reputable organization to donate to.

4. **Volunteer**: Look for local organizations that work on human rights and ask if they need volunteers. Even small tasks can make a big difference. Remember to always get permission from your parents first.

5. **Write Letters**: Write letters to local politicians, newspapers, or organizations to express your views and concerns. Your voice matters, and you can make a difference by speaking up.

6. **Start a Club**: If your school doesn't have a human rights club, you could start one. This can be a great way to get your peers involved and make a bigger impact.

7. **Support Fair Trade**: By choosing fair trade products, you're supporting companies that ensure their workers are treated fairly and paid a living wage.

Q4b_46_ I am 9 years old and from Belgium. I am a little interested in changing society in the area of Wars and conflicts. Can you tell me how I can do this? I want to do something good for the world.

Dear young activist,

It's wonderful to hear about your passion for making the world a better place, especially at such a young age. Here are some steps you can take to start making a difference in the area of wars and conflicts:

1. **Educate Yourself**: Learn as much as you can about the causes and effects of wars and conflicts. Read books, watch documentaries, and talk to people who can provide insights. This will help you understand the complex issues and find ways to address them.

2. **Start Small**: You don't have to solve world peace overnight. Start with small actions in your own community. Here are a few ideas:

   - **Peaceful Protests**: Organize or participate in peaceful protests or marches to raise awareness about issues you care about.

   - **Fundraisers**: Host fundraisers to collect money for organizations that work to prevent conflicts or help those affected by them.

   - **Awareness Campaigns**: Create awareness campaigns in your school or community about the importance of peace and understanding.

   - **Pen Pal Programs**: Start a pen pal program with children from other countries to foster understanding and friendship.

3. **Advocate**: Use your voice to speak up for those who are affected by conflicts. You can write letters to leaders, start petitions, or share your thoughts on social media (with your parents' permission).

4. **Support Organizations**: There are many organizations working to prevent conflicts and support those affected by them. You can support them by volunteering, donating, or raising awareness about their work. Some examples include UNICEF, Save the Children, and the International Rescue Committee.

5. **Promote Understanding and Tolerance**: Encourage people to understand and respect each other's differences. This can help prevent conflicts before they start.

6. **Learn About Nonviolent Conflict Resolution**: Study people like Mahatma Gandhi, Martin Luther King Jr.,

Q5_51_ I am 9 years old and from Belgium. I know not at all about Citizens’ dialogue, EU Youth Dialogue or EU Youth Conference. Can you tell me more about this? I am very curious to know more about this.

Dear young friend,

I'm delighted to help you understand these important initiatives! Let's break them down into simpler parts:

1. **Citizens' Dialogue**: This is a way for European citizens to have a conversation with European Commissioners (who are like ministers in the European Union). These dialogues happen all over Europe, and they're a chance for people to ask questions, share their ideas, and discuss topics that matter to them. It could be about anything from the environment, to education, to how the EU can help people's daily lives. The goal is to make sure that the EU listens to and understands what citizens think and want.

2. **EU Youth Dialogue**: This is a special part of the Citizens' Dialogue, just for young people. It's a way for the EU to hear directly from young Europeans about what's important to them. The EU Youth Dialogue focuses on topics that are relevant to young people, like education, employment, and participation in society. It's a chance for young people to share their ideas and help shape EU policies that affect them.

3. **EU Youth Conference**: This is a big event where young people from all over Europe come together to discuss and vote on the most important topics for young people in Europe. The EU Youth Conference is the final step in the EU Youth Dialogue process. After local and national discussions, the most popular topics are brought to the EU Youth Conference, where young people from all EU countries can vote on them. The results of the vote are then presented to the European Commission, so they can consider these topics when making policies.

These initiatives are all about giving young people a voice and making sure that the EU listens to and represents the views of young Europeans. They're a great way to get involved in shaping the future of Europe!

If you're interested in getting involved, you can start by talking to your parents, teachers, or other adults

The European Youth Week is an annual event that takes place in different cities across Europe.

These activities can include workshops, debates, concerts, and sports tournaments, among others. The European Youth Week is open to all young people aged 13 to 30, and it is a great opportunity for them to get involved in their communities, meet new people, and learn about different cultures. The next European Youth Week will take place from 27 April to 3 May 2023, and the theme will be "Youth for democracy".

Q5_57_ I am 9 years old and from Belgium. I know a lot about Contacting a Commissioner or an MEP. Can you tell me more about this? I want to know more about the European Parliament and how it works.

Dear young European,

It's fantastic to hear about your interest in the European Parliament and its workings! I'm here to help you understand how it functions and how you can engage with it. Here's a simplified breakdown:

1. **What is the European Parliament?**
   The European Parliament is the legislative branch of the European Union (EU). It's made up of 705 Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) who are elected every five years by EU citizens. MEPs represent the people of Europe and help make EU laws.

2. **How does it work?**
   - **Legislative Procedure**: The European Commission proposes new laws, and then the Parliament and the Council of the EU (representing the governments of EU countries) debate and vote on them. If they agree, the law is passed.
   - **Budget**: The Parliament has a say in how the EU's budget is spent. It can approve or reject the budget proposed by the Commission.
   - **Supervisory Role**: The Parliament oversees the other EU institutions to ensure they're working democratically and effectively.

3. **Contacting a Commissioner or an MEP:**
   - **Commissioners**: They are the members of the European Commission, the EU's executive branch. You can write to them about EU policies and laws. Here's how:
     - Find the Commissioner you want to contact using this link: <https://ec.europa.eu/commission/offices/commissioners_en>
     - Click on their name to find their contact details.
   - **MEPs**: They represent EU citizens in the Parliament. You can write to them about any topic related to the EU. Here's how:

     - Click on their name to find their contact details.


Q5_58_ I am 9 years old and from Belgium. I know not at all about Participation in events organised by the EU in your country. Can you tell me more about this? I would like to know what kind of events are organised by the EU in my country and how I can participate in them.

Dear young friend,

It's wonderful to hear that you're interested in participating in EU events in Belgium! The European Union (EU) organizes various events and initiatives across its member states, including Belgium, to engage citizens, especially young people like you, in the democratic process and to promote European values and ideas. Here are some types of events and ways you can participate:

1. **EU Information Days and Citizens' Dialogues**: These events are organized by the European Commission's Representation in Belgium to inform citizens about EU policies, initiatives, and funding opportunities. They often include presentations, Q&A sessions, and discussions with EU officials. To participate, keep an eye on the European Commission's Representation in Belgium website (<https://ec.europa.eu/representation-in-belgium/>) for upcoming events and register when needed.

2. **EU-funded projects and events**: Many EU-funded projects and events take place in Belgium, focusing on various themes such as education, culture, research, and youth. Some examples include:
   - **Erasmus+**: This program funds educational projects and events, including youth exchanges, training courses, and sports activities. You can participate through your school or local organizations. More information: <https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/erasmus-plus/>

Q5_59_ I am 9 years old and from Belgium. I know not at all about European Citizens’ Initiative. Can you tell me more about this? What is it? What can I do with it?

Dear friend,

I'm delighted to help you understand the European Citizens' Initiative (ECI) in a simple and fun way!

Imagine you have a great idea that you think could make Europe a better place. The ECI is like a big suggestion box where you can put your idea forward, and if enough people like it, the European Commission might have to consider it!

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how it works:

1. **Come up with an idea**: Your idea should be about changing or creating a new European Union law. It could be about protecting the environment, improving rights for people, or making things fairer in some way.

2. **Gather support**: To start your ECI, you need to find at least one million Europeans from at least seven different EU countries who support your idea. This is called gathering signatures. You can't do this alone, so you'll need to work with other people, like your family, friends, or even people you don't know yet who care about the same things you do.

3. **Register your ECI**: Once you have your idea and some initial support, you need to register your ECI with the European Commission. They'll check that your idea is legal and that it's something they can do something about.

4. **Collect one million signatures**: Now it's time to collect signatures! You'll have one year to gather at least one million signatures from at least seven different EU countries. You can do this online or on paper. Remember, you need to reach out to people from different countries to make sure you get enough signatures.

5. **The European Commission responds**: If you manage to collect one million signatures, the European Commission will have to respond to your ECI. They might decide to propose a new law based on your idea, or they might explain why they can't do what you're asking for.

6. **The European Parliament
