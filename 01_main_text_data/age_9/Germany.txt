3. **Plant Trees**: Trees absorb carbon dioxide, which helps combat climate change. You can plant trees in your backyard, a local park, or participate in a community tree-planting event.

4. **Conserve Water**: Turn off the tap while brushing your teeth or washing your hands. Fix any leaks in your home's plumbing. Collect rainwater to water your plants.

6. **Protect Wildlife**: Create a safe space for wildlife in your backyard by installing bird feeders, birdhouses, or bat boxes. Never litter, as it can harm or kill wildlife.

7. **Adopt, Don't Shop**: If you're thinking about getting a pet, consider adopting from a shelter instead of buying from a pet store. This helps reduce the demand for puppy mills and gives a home to an animal in need.

Dear friend,

It's wonderful to hear that you're already thinking about how you can make a positive impact on the world. Here are some steps you can take, even at your young age, to contribute to peace and understanding:

Q5_51_ I am 9 years old and from Germany. I know not at all about Citizens’ dialogue, EU Youth Dialogue or EU Youth Conference. Can you tell me more about this? I am very interested in politics and I would like to know more about it.

Dear friend,

It's wonderful to hear about your interest in politics at such a young age! I'm here to help explain these concepts in a way that's easy to understand.

1. **Citizens' Dialogue**: Imagine you're having a conversation with your friends about something you all care about, like your favorite game or a book you've read. Now, imagine that conversation happening on a larger scale, with people from all over Europe, and the topic is about how the European Union (EU) should work or what it should do. That's what a Citizens' Dialogue is like!

   The EU organizes these dialogues to hear what citizens like you think about different topics. They want to know your ideas, concerns, and suggestions so they can make decisions that reflect the will of the people. These dialogues can happen in person, online, or through written contributions.

2. **EU Youth Dialogue**: This is a special kind of dialogue just for young people like you! It's a platform where young Europeans can share their ideas and opinions on topics that matter to them, like education, jobs, or the environment. The EU listens to these conversations and uses them to shape policies that affect young people.

   The EU Youth Dialogue happens in several steps. First, there are national debates in each EU country, where young people discuss the chosen topic. Then, a group of young people, called the European Youth Event (EYE) Ambassadors, collects and summarizes these ideas. Finally, the EU Commission, which is like the government of the EU, responds to these ideas and explains how they will use them to make decisions.

3. **EU Youth Conference**: This is a big event where young people from all over Europe come together to discuss and vote on the most important ideas from the EU Youth Dialogue. It's like a big meeting where you get to have your say

Q5_53_ I am 9 years old and from Germany. I know kind of about European elections. Can you tell me more about this? What are they and why are they important?

Dear 9-year-old,

I'm delighted to help you understand the European elections! Let's break it down into simpler parts:

1. **What are the European elections?**
   Imagine you have a big school, and you want to choose some representatives to help make decisions for the whole school. These representatives will be part of a council that discusses and votes on important rules for the school. The European elections are like that, but instead of a school, it's the European Union (EU), which is a group of 27 countries in Europe.

   Every 5 years, people in these 27 countries vote for Members of the European Parliament (MEPs). These MEPs then go to the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France, to represent their countries and make decisions together.

2. **Why are they important?**
   The European Parliament is like the voice of the people in the EU. Here's why their work is important:

   - **Making laws**: The European Parliament, together with the Council of the EU (which represents the governments of the member countries), makes new laws for the EU. These laws can affect many aspects of our lives, like how we travel, what we eat, or how we protect the environment.

   - **Controlling money**: The European Parliament helps decide how the EU's budget is spent. This money is used for many things, like supporting farmers, helping research and development, or improving roads and railways.

   - **Supervising the EU**: The European Parliament keeps an eye on how the EU is run and makes sure that the EU's institutions are working properly and fairly.

   - **Representing people**: The European Parliament gives people in the EU a chance to have their say about how the EU is run. By voting in the European elections, you can help choose who will represent you and your country in the European Parliament.

In summary, the European elections are a way for
Q5_54_ I am 9 years old and from Germany. I know a little about EU social media channels and websites (i.e. European Youth Portal). Can you tell me more about this? I would like to know more about the EU and how it works.

It has several institutions that work together to make decisions and implement policies for the benefit of its citizens. Here's a brief overview of some key EU institutions and their online presence:

1. **European Commission**: This is the executive branch of the EU, responsible for proposing legislation and enforcing EU laws. They have an active online presence:

Q5_55_ I am 9 years old and from Germany. I know not at all about Visit of the EU institutions. Can you tell me more about this? Thank you.

The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of 27 member states that are primarily located in Europe. The EU has several institutions that help it function and make decisions. Here are some of the main ones and their roles:

1. **European Parliament**: This is the only directly elected EU institution. It represents the people of Europe and has the power to pass laws and approve the EU's budget. It's based in Strasbourg, France, but also holds meetings in Brussels, Belgium.

2. **Council of the European Union**: This is where national ministers from each EU country meet to discuss and decide on EU policies. The Council is based in Brussels, and the presidency of the Council rotates among the member states every six months.

3. **European Commission**: This is the executive body of the EU. It proposes new laws, manages the day-to-day business of the EU, and makes sure that EU laws are enforced. The Commission is based in Brussels, and its president is chosen by the European Council and approved by the European Parliament.

4. **European Council**: This is where the heads of state or government of the EU member states, along with the President of the European Commission and the President of the European Parliament, meet to set the EU's political agenda and take decisions on major issues. The European Council meets in Brussels.

5. **European Court of Justice**: This is the highest court in the EU. It makes sure that EU law is interpreted and applied correctly. It's based in Luxembourg.

6. **European Central Bank (ECB)**: The ECB is responsible for managing the euro, the currency used by 19 of the EU's member states. It's based in Frankfurt, Germany.

Each of these institutions plays a crucial role in the functioning of the EU, and they work together to ensure that the EU operates smoothly and effectively.
Q5_56_ I am 9 years old and from Germany. I know not at all about The European Youth Week or the European Youth Event. Can you tell me more about this? I would like to know what it is and how I can participate.

The European Youth Week and the European Youth Event are initiatives organized by the European Union to engage young people in the democratic process and to give them a voice in shaping the future of Europe. Here's a simple breakdown of both events:

1. **European Youth Week (EYW)**: This is an annual event that takes place in early May. It's a decentralized initiative, which means it happens in different cities across Europe, organized by local authorities, youth organizations, and other partners. The goal is to bring young people together to discuss and share ideas on various topics, such as democracy, human rights, the environment, and digitalization. The EYW also aims to raise awareness about the opportunities and rights that young people have as EU citizens.

   To participate, you can check if there are any events happening near you. You can find this information on the European Youth Portal (https://europa.eu/youth/portal/home_en) or by contacting your local municipality or youth organizations.

2. **European Youth Event (EYE)**: This is a larger, more centralized event that takes place every two years in the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France. It's a unique opportunity for young people to meet and discuss with decision-makers, learn about the EU's institutions and policies, and share their ideas on how to build a better Europe. The EYE also includes workshops, debates, and cultural activities.

   To participate in the EYE, you need to be between 16 and 30 years old. You can apply online through the European Parliament's website (https://www.europarl.europa.eu/portal/en/european-youth-event/EYE2023) when the application period opens. Unfortunately, you're a bit young to participate in the EYE at the moment, but you can keep an eye on the website for future events.

Q5_57_ I am 9 years old and from Germany. I know a lot about Contacting a Commissioner or an MEP. Can you tell me more about this? I want to know more about the European Parliament and how it works.

Dear young friend,

I'm delighted to hear about your interest in the European Parliament and its workings! It's fantastic that you're taking an active role in understanding how the EU operates. Let's break down the European Parliament and its processes into simpler parts for you.

1. **What is the European Parliament?**
The European Parliament is the legislative branch of the European Union (EU). It's like the parliament in your own country, but for the whole EU. It's responsible for making and changing laws that apply to all EU countries.

2. **Who are the Members of the European Parliament (MEPs)?**
MEPs are elected by citizens of EU countries to represent them in the European Parliament. They come from all 27 EU countries and are elected every five years. Each country has a different number of MEPs, depending on its population. Germany, being one of the largest countries, has the most MEPs – 96.

3. **What does the European Parliament do?**
The European Parliament has several important tasks:

   - **Legislation**: It makes and changes laws together with the Council of the EU (which represents the governments of the member states). This is called the ordinary legislative procedure, or co-decision procedure.

   - **Budget**: It approves or rejects the EU's budget.

   - **Supervision**: It supervises the work of the European Commission (the EU's executive branch) and can force the Commission to resign by adopting a motion of censure.

   - **International agreements**: It gives consent to international agreements made by the EU.

Q5_59_ I am 9 years old and from Germany. I know a little about European Citizens’ Initiative. Can you tell me more about this? What is it and how does it work?

Hello! It's great to hear that you're interested in learning about the European Citizens’ Initiative (ECI). I'll do my best to explain it in a way that's easy to understand.

The European Citizens’ Initiative is a unique tool that allows citizens of the European Union (EU) to participate directly in the EU's democratic life. It was introduced in 2012 as part of the Treaty of Lisbon, which is a big agreement between the EU countries about how the EU should work.

Here's how it works:

1. **Who can start an ECI?**
   - At least 7 EU citizens from at least 7 different EU countries can start an ECI. They need to form a citizens' committee and register their initiative with the European Commission.

2. **What can an ECI be about?**
   - An ECI can be about changing or creating new EU laws. However, it can't be about things that are already covered by the EU treaties, like the EU's budget or foreign policy.

3. **Gathering signatures:**
   - Once an ECI is registered, the citizens' committee has one year to gather at least 1 million signatures from EU citizens. These signatures must come from at least 7 different EU countries, and the number of signatures from each country must be proportional to the size of that country's population.

4. **What happens after the signatures are gathered?**
   - If the ECI gathers enough signatures, the European Commission will examine the initiative and decide whether to propose a legal act based on the ECI's demands. The Commission can also decide not to act if it thinks the initiative is not within the EU's powers or if it's already dealing with the issue in another way.

5. **Parliament and Council:**
   - If the Commission decides to propose a legal act, it will go to the European Parliament and the Council of the EU
