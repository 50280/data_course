3. **Community Service**: Participate in local community service projects. This could be anything from cleaning up a local park, helping at an animal shelter, or volunteering at a food bank. These activities not only help your community but also give you a chance to meet like-minded people and learn about different causes.

Q1_4_ I am 9 years old and from Greece. I think that to make my voice heard Contacting a politician about an issue is not at all effective. Can you give me more ways of doing this? I want to make my voice heard about the climate crisis.

Dear 9-year-old,

It's wonderful to hear that you're already thinking about how to make your voice heard on important issues like the climate crisis. Here are some ways you can take action:

1. **Write Letters or Emails**: You can write letters or emails to politicians, but also to newspapers, magazines, or even companies that you think could do more to protect the environment. Make sure your message is clear, polite, and explains why you care about the issue.

2. **Join or Start a Club**: You can join or start a club at your school or in your community focused on environmental issues. This can help you connect with others who care about the same things and work together to make a difference.

3. **Participate in Protests or Marches**: There are often protests or marches organized to raise awareness about environmental issues. These can be a powerful way to show that many people care about the same things. Remember to always stay safe and follow the rules.

4. **Plant Trees or Clean Up Your Community**: You can organize or participate in tree-planting events or community clean-up days. This can help make your local environment healthier and show others that you care.

5. **Reduce, Reuse, Recycle**: You can make changes in your own life to reduce your impact on the environment. This could mean using less water, turning off lights when you leave a room, or bringing your own bag to the store instead of using plastic ones.

Q1_5_ I am 9 years old and from Greece. I think that to make my voice heard Volunteering for a charity/campaign organisation is a little effective. Can you give me more ways of doing this? I want to help the environment and animals.

3. **Plant Trees**: Trees absorb carbon dioxide, which helps combat climate change. You can plant trees in your backyard, school, or a local park. You can also participate in community tree-planting events.

4. **Conserve Water**: Turn off the tap while brushing your teeth or washing your hands. Fix any leaks in your home. Collect rainwater to water plants.

5. **Save Energy**: Turn off lights and electronics when not in use. Use energy-efficient light bulbs. Encourage your family to use public transportation, carpool, or ride a bike instead of driving.

7. **Adopt, Don't Shop**: If you want a pet, consider adopting from a shelter instead of buying from a pet store. This helps reduce the demand for puppy mills and gives a home to an animal in need.

Q3_30_ I am 9 years old and from Greece. I have never taken part in activities that relate to democratic participation because I don’t understand the issues enough. For my friends, this is kind of the same. Can you tell me more about how I can do that? I would like to know more about how I can participate in democratic activities.

Dear friend,

It's wonderful to hear that you're interested in democratic participation! At your age, there are many ways you can start getting involved and learning about democracy. Here are some suggestions:

1. **Learn about democracy**: Start by understanding what democracy is. It's a system of government where power is vested in the people, who rule either directly or through freely elected representatives. You can read books, watch videos, or talk to your teachers and parents about it.

2. **School activities**: Many schools have student councils or similar organizations where students can participate in decision-making processes. If your school doesn't have one, you could suggest starting one. You can also participate in school elections, if there are any.

3. **Community involvement**: Look for opportunities to get involved in your local community. This could be through volunteering, joining a club or group that interests you, or participating in community events. These activities can help you understand local issues and how decisions are made.

4. **Environmental awareness**: You can start a recycling program at your school, plant trees in your community, or participate in clean-up activities. These actions not only help the environment but also teach you about civic responsibility and community engagement.

5. **Online platforms**: There are many online platforms where you can express your opinion and participate in discussions. However, always remember to stay safe online and only share information that you're comfortable with.

6. **Talk to others**: Discuss your thoughts and ideas with your family, friends, and teachers. This can help you understand different perspectives and develop your own views.

7. **Youth parliaments and simulations**: Some organizations host youth parliaments or simulations where you can role-play as a politician and debate on various issues. This can be a great way to learn about the democratic process.

8. **Write letters**: You can write letters to your local representatives about issues

Dear friend,

It's wonderful to hear that you're interested in democratic participation! At your age, there are many ways you can get involved and make a difference in your school and community. Here are some ideas:

1. **School Council or Student Government:** Many schools have a student council or government where students can voice their opinions and help make decisions. If your school doesn't have one, you could start a petition to create one. You could also ask your teachers or the school principal about how to get involved.

3. **Fundraising Events:** You could organize or participate in fundraising events for a cause you care about. This could be anything from a bake sale to a sponsored walk or run.

4. **Community Service:** You could volunteer your time to help out in your community. This could be anything from helping at a local charity shop, to visiting elderly neighbors, or helping with community clean-up days.

5. **Youth Parliament or Youth Council:** Some cities have youth parliaments or councils where young people can have a say in local decisions. You could ask your local council or mayor's office about this.

6. **Petitions and Campaigns:** If there's an issue you care about, you could start a petition or campaign to raise awareness and bring about change. This could be anything from improving school lunches to protecting local green spaces.

7. **Debate and Public Speaking:** Joining a debate or public speaking club can help you develop the skills you need to express your opinions and influence others.

Q4b_44_ I am 9 years old and from Greece. I am a little interested in changing society in the area of Equal rights regardless of gender, race or sexuality. Can you tell me how I can do this? I want to do something that will make a difference.

Thank you for your question. It's wonderful to hear that you're already thinking about how to make the world a better place. Here are some steps you can take to start making a difference in the area of equal rights:

1. **Educate Yourself**: Learn about different forms of discrimination and the importance of equal rights. You can read books, watch documentaries, or talk to people who are knowledgeable about these topics. Some books that might be suitable for your age include "Wonder" by R.J. Palacio, "Inside I'm Hurting" by Louise Gornall, and "The Day You Begin" by Jacqueline Woodson.

2. **Talk to Others**: Discuss what you've learned with your family, friends, and teachers. Encourage them to think about these issues too. You can start conversations by asking questions like, "Why do you think it's important to treat everyone equally?" or "Have you ever seen someone being treated unfairly?"

3. **Stand Up for Others**: If you see someone being treated unfairly, try to intervene in a safe and appropriate way. This could be as simple as telling a joke to lighten the mood, or it could involve standing up for someone who's being bullied. Remember, it's important to prioritize your own safety first.

4. **Start a Club or Group**: You could start a club at your school or in your community that focuses on promoting equality. This could be a place where people can discuss these issues, plan activities, and support each other.

5. **Participate in Community Events**: Look for local events that support equal rights, like pride parades, women's marches, or interfaith gatherings. Participating in these events can help you feel more connected to a larger community of people who care about these issues.

6. **Write Letters or Petitions**: If there's a specific issue you care about, you can

Dear friend,

It's wonderful to hear that you're interested in learning more about the EU Youth Dialogue and EU Youth Conference! I'll do my best to explain these events and how you can participate.

1. **EU Youth Dialogue**: This is an ongoing process that aims to give young people a say in matters that affect them. It's a way for young people to share their ideas and concerns with policymakers at the European level. The dialogue focuses on different themes each year, such as education, employment, participation, and digital youth work.

   To participate, you can:
   - Join the EU Youth Dialogue online platform (https://europa.eu/youth/youth-dialogue_en) and share your ideas and opinions.
   - Look for local or national events related to the EU Youth Dialogue in your country. These events are often organized by youth organizations, schools, or local authorities. You can ask your teachers, youth workers, or local officials about these events.
   - If you're part of a youth organization, you can also encourage them to participate in the EU Youth Dialogue.

2. **EU Youth Conference**: This is a yearly event where around 100 young people from all over Europe come together to discuss and vote on recommendations for the European Youth Goals. These goals are a set of priorities for youth policy in Europe, and they're based on the ideas and experiences of young people themselves.

   To participate in the EU Youth Conference, you'll need to be nominated by your country. Here's how you can do that:
   - Look for national selection processes in your country. These are usually organized by national youth councils or other youth organizations. You can ask your teachers, youth workers, or local officials about these processes.
   - If you're part of a youth organization, you can also ask them to nominate you.

Dear friend,

I'm delighted to hear that you're interested in learning more about the European Union (EU) and its social media channels and websites! The EU has several platforms designed to engage with young people like you, so let's explore some of them together.

   - The European Youth Portal is an excellent starting point for young people interested in the EU. It provides information on various topics, such as education, work, volunteering, and youth rights.
   - You can find opportunities for internships, traineeships, and jobs within EU institutions, as well as information on European Youth Events and initiatives.
   - The portal is available in all official EU languages, including Greek.

2. **EU40 (https://www.eu40.org/)**
   - EU40 is a network of young professionals working in EU institutions, national representations, and other EU-related organizations. They aim to connect young people with the EU and foster a better understanding of its workings.
   - While you might not be able to participate in their events yet, you can follow their activities and learn from their content.

3. **EU Social Media Channels**
   - The EU has a strong presence on various social media platforms, making it easy for young people to stay informed and engaged. Here are some channels you might find interesting:

Q5_55_ I am 9 years old and from Greece. I know not at all about Visit of the EU institutions. Can you tell me more about this? Thank you.

The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of 27 member states that are primarily located in Europe. The EU has several institutions that help it function and make decisions. Here are some of the main EU institutions and their roles:

1. **European Commission**: This is the executive branch of the EU. It proposes new laws, manages the day-to-day business of the EU, and makes sure that EU laws are enforced. The Commission is led by a President and has one Commissioner from each member state.

2. **European Parliament**: This is the only directly elected EU institution. It represents the people of Europe and has the power to pass laws and approve the EU's budget. It's based in Strasbourg, France, but also meets in Brussels, Belgium.

3. **Council of the European Union**: This is where national ministers from each EU country meet to discuss and decide on EU policies. The Council is chaired by a different member state every six months.

4. **European Council**: This is where the heads of state or government of the EU member states, along with its President and the President of the Commission, meet to set the EU's political agenda and take decisions on major issues.

5. **European Court of Justice**: This court ensures that EU law is interpreted and applied correctly. It also settles disputes between EU institutions, member states, and companies or individuals.

6. **European Central Bank (ECB)**: The ECB is responsible for managing the euro, the currency of 19 EU member states. It also helps to keep prices stable in the euro area.

7. **Court of Auditors**: This court checks how EU money is spent and ensures that it is used legally and properly.

These institutions work together to make decisions and ensure that the EU functions smoothly. They are all based in Brussels, Belgium, except for the European Parliament (which also meets in Strasbourg) and the European Central Bank (which is based
Q5_56_ I am 9 years old and from Greece. I know a little about The European Youth Week or the European Youth Event. Can you tell me more about this? What is it? What do young people do there? What is the purpose of this event?

The European Youth Week and the European Youth Event (EYE) are two important initiatives organized by the European Union (EU) to engage and involve young people in the democratic life of Europe. Here's a simple breakdown for you:

1. **European Youth Week (EYW)**: This is an annual event that takes place in late April or early May. It's a decentralized event, which means it happens in different cities across Europe, not just in one place. The purpose of EYW is to:
   - Celebrate youth and youth work.
   - Showcase the impact of youth work on young people's lives.
   - Promote the importance of youth participation in society.
   - Encourage young people to get involved in their communities and in European decision-making processes.

   During EYW, various activities are organized, such as workshops, debates, cultural events, and sports activities. These events are usually organized by local authorities, youth organizations, and other partners.

2. **European Youth Event (EYE)**: This is a larger, more centralized event that happens every three years in the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France. The next EYE will take place in May 2023. The purpose of EYE is to:
   - Bring together young people from all over Europe to discuss and debate on European topics.
   - Give young people the opportunity to share their ideas and opinions with European decision-makers.
   - Encourage young people to engage in European politics and to become active citizens.

Q5_59_ I am 9 years old and from Greece. I know not at all about European Citizens’ Initiative. Can you tell me more about this? What is it? What can I do with it?

Hello! It's great to hear that you're interested in learning about the European Citizens’ Initiative (ECI). I'll explain it in a simple way so that it's easy for you to understand.

The European Citizens’ Initiative is a way for citizens of the European Union (EU) to directly influence the EU's agenda. It's like a petition, but it's special because it's designed to give EU citizens a voice in the EU's decision-making process.

Here's how it works:

1. **Who can start an ECI?** Any EU citizen, or a group of EU citizens, can start an ECI. They need to be at least 18 years old and have the support of at least one million EU citizens from at least seven different EU countries.

2. **What can an ECI be about?** The ECI can be about changing or creating new EU laws. However, it can't be about things that are already covered by the EU treaties, or things that the EU doesn't have the power to do.

3. **How does an ECI work?** Once an ECI is started, it needs to collect signatures from at least one million EU citizens from at least seven different EU countries within one year. If it gets enough signatures, the European Commission (which is like the government of the EU) has to decide whether to take action on the issue.

4. **What can you do with an ECI?** As a 9-year-old, you might not be able to start an ECI yourself (because you need to be 18), but you can still help! You can talk to your parents, teachers, and friends about ECIs, and you can help collect signatures if there's an ECI you believe in. You can also learn more about the EU and the issues that ECIs are trying to address.

Here are some ECIs that are currently open and collecting signatures
