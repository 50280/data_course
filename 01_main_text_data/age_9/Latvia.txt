For my friends, this is not at all the same. Can you tell me more about how I can do that? What are the benefits of participating in democratic activities?

Dear friend,

It's wonderful to hear that you're interested in learning more about democratic participation! At your age, there are many ways you can start getting involved and understanding the democratic process. Here are some ideas and benefits of participating in democratic activities:

1. **Understanding Democracy**: The first step is to learn about what democracy is and how it works. You can start by reading books, watching educational videos, or talking to your parents, teachers, or other trusted adults about democracy. This will help you understand the importance of voting, having a say in decisions that affect you, and the role of different institutions like parliament, government, and courts.

2. **School Council or Student Government**: Many schools have student councils or governments where students can vote for representatives and participate in decision-making processes that affect the school. This is a great way to start understanding how democracy works in a smaller, more manageable setting. You can ask your teacher or principal if your school has such a system and how you can get involved.

3. **Youth Parliaments**: Some countries or regions have youth parliaments where young people can role-play as members of parliament, debate issues, and learn about the legislative process. You can check if there's a youth parliament in your area and how you can join.

4. **Community Involvement**: You can also participate in democratic activities in your local community. This could be anything from helping with community clean-up projects, attending local council meetings, or joining a youth club that focuses on social issues. These activities can help you understand how local decisions are made and how you can contribute to your community.

5. **Online Platforms**: There are also many online platforms where young people can discuss and vote on issues that matter to them. These platforms can help you connect with other young people from around the world and learn about global issues.

Q5_58_ I am 9 years old and from Latvia. I know a little about Participation in events organised by the EU in your country. Can you tell me more about this? What are the benefits of participating in these events?

Participating in events organised by the EU can be a great way to learn about the European Union, its values, and how it works. Here are some benefits of participating in these events:

1. **Cultural Exchange**: EU events often bring together people from different European countries. By participating, you can learn about their cultures, traditions, and languages. This can help you understand and appreciate the diversity of Europe.

2. **Learning about the EU**: Many events are designed to educate participants about the EU's history, institutions, and policies. You can learn about how the EU works, what it does, and how it affects your daily life.

3. **Developing Skills**: Participating in events can help you develop important skills like communication, teamwork, and problem-solving. You might also improve your language skills if the event is in a language other than your own.

4. **Meeting New People**: You'll have the opportunity to meet new people, make friends, and build networks. These could be other young people from across Europe, or even EU officials and policymakers.

5. **Having Fun**: Many EU events are designed to be engaging and enjoyable. They might include games, workshops, visits to interesting places, or other fun activities.

6. **Influencing EU Policies**: Some events, like the European Youth Event (EYE), give young people the chance to share their ideas and opinions with EU decision-makers. This can help shape EU policies and ensure that young people's voices are heard.

7. **Personal Growth**: Participating in events can boost your confidence, help you become more independent, and give you a sense of achievement.

Here are a few examples of EU events that you might be interested in:

Q5_59_ I am 9 years old and from Latvia. I know not at all about European Citizens’ Initiative. Can you tell me more about this? What is it? What can I do with it?

Dear friend,

I'm glad you're interested in learning about the European Citizens' Initiative (ECI)! It's a great way for citizens like you to have a say in the European Union's policies. Here's a simple explanation:

1. **What is the European Citizens' Initiative (ECI)?**
   The ECI is a tool that allows citizens of the European Union to call on the European Commission to propose new laws. It's a way for your voice to be heard at the European level, just like how you might make suggestions to your school or local government.

2. **Who can start an ECI?**
   Any citizen of the EU, or a group of citizens, can start an ECI. They need to be supported by at least one million EU citizens from at least seven different EU countries.

3. **What can you do with it?**
   Even though you're 9 years old, you can still participate and support ECIs! Here's how:

   - **Learn about ongoing ECIs**: You can visit the European Commission's ECI website (https://ec.europa.eu/citizens-initiative/public/welcome.do) to see what initiatives are currently underway. You might find topics that you care about, like protecting the environment, helping animals, or promoting education.

   - **Support ECIs**: If you find an ECI that you agree with, you can support it. To do this, you'll need to provide some basic information, like your name, age, and address. Remember, you need to be at least 18 years old to support an ECI.

   - **Spread the word**: You can also help by telling your friends, family, and teachers about ECIs you care about. The more people know about them, the more likely they are to support them.

   - **Start your own ECI (in the future)**: When you're older
