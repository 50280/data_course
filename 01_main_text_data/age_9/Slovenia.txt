4. **Conserve Water**: Turn off the tap while brushing your teeth, take shorter showers, and fix any leaks in your home. You can also collect rainwater to water your plants.

7. **Adopt, Don't Shop**: If you want a pet, consider adopting from a shelter instead of buying from a pet store. This helps reduce the demand for puppy mills and gives a home to an animal in need.

Q3_30_ I am 9 years old and from Slovenia. I have never taken part in activities that relate to democratic participation because I don’t understand the issues enough. For my friends, this is kind of the same. Can you tell me more about how I can do that? I would like to be more involved in the democratic process.

Dear friend,

It's wonderful to hear that you're interested in getting involved in democratic participation! At your age, there are many ways you can start to understand and engage with democratic processes. Here are some suggestions:

1. **Learn about democracy**: Start by learning about what democracy is, its importance, and how it works. You can read books, watch educational videos, or talk to your parents, teachers, or other trusted adults about it. Some recommended books for your age group include "Democracy is a Garden" by George Ancona and "If I Ran for President" by Catherine Stier.

2. **School activities**: Participate in school activities that involve decision-making and voting. This could be anything from choosing a class representative to deciding on a school event. These experiences can help you understand how voting and representation work in a democratic system.

3. **Join a club or organization**: Joining a club or organization, like a sports team, a music group, or an environmental club, can give you hands-on experience with democratic processes. You'll learn about making decisions together, compromising, and respecting others' opinions.

4. **Discuss issues with friends and family**: Talk to your friends and family about issues that matter to you, like protecting the environment, helping others, or improving your school. Discussing these topics can help you develop your own opinions and understand different perspectives.

5. **Write letters or create art**: If there's an issue you care about, you can write a letter to your local representative, the mayor, or even the prime minister. You can also create art, like drawings or posters, to raise awareness about issues you care about. This can help you express your opinions and make a difference in your community.

Thank you for your question. It's great to hear that you're interested in getting involved in your community and learning more about democratic participation. Here are some ways you can start:

1. **School Activities**: Many schools have student councils or similar organizations where students can voice their opinions and help make decisions. If your school doesn't have one, you could start a club or group to discuss and address issues that matter to you and your peers.

2. **Community Service**: You can volunteer for local organizations or charities. This could be anything from helping at a local animal shelter, participating in community clean-up days, or helping out at a food bank. These activities not only help your community but also give you a chance to meet and work with others.

3. **Local Government Meetings**: Many local governments have meetings that are open to the public. You could attend these meetings to learn about what's happening in your community and how decisions are made. Some meetings might even allow you to speak or ask questions.

4. **Petitions and Campaigns**: If there's an issue you care about, you could start a petition or a campaign to raise awareness and encourage change. This could be anything from improving your school's lunch menu to advocating for more recycling bins in your neighborhood.

5. **Youth Parliaments and Mock Elections**: These are great ways to learn about how democracy works. They allow you to role-play as a politician, debate issues, and vote on proposals.

6. **Online Platforms**: There are many online platforms where you can voice your opinion and connect with others who share your interests. However, always remember to stay safe online and never share personal information.

7. **Talk to Adults**: Speak to your parents, teachers, or other adults in your community about your interests. They might have suggestions or know about opportunities that you hadn't considered.

Dear friend,

It's great to hear that you're interested in democratic participation! Even though some activities might be far away, there are still many ways you can get involved and make your voice heard. Here are some suggestions:

3. **School Council or Student Parliament**: If your school doesn't have one, you could start a school council or student parliament. This would give you and your classmates a say in how your school is run.

4. **Write Letters or E-mails**: You can write letters or e-mails to local politicians, members of parliament, or other decision-makers. Share your thoughts on issues that matter to you. They might not always respond, but they do read these messages and they can help shape their policies.

5. **Petitions**: If there's an issue you care about, you can start a petition. Websites like Change.org make it easy to create and share petitions online.

Q4b_43_ I am 9 years old and from Slovenia. I am a little interested in changing society in the area of Economic inequality and welfare expenditure. Can you tell me how I can do this? I want to do something good for the world.

Hello! It's wonderful to hear that you're already thinking about how to make a positive impact on the world at such a young age. Here are some steps you can take to start addressing economic inequality and advocating for increased welfare expenditure:

2. **Start Small**: Begin by making a difference in your own community. Here are a few ideas:

   - **Fundraising**: Organize a small fundraising event, like a bake sale or a car wash, to raise money for a local charity that focuses on poverty or welfare. You could also ask your school if you can start a charity club.

   - **Awareness Campaigns**: Start a campaign in your school or community to raise awareness about economic inequality. You could create posters, give presentations, or even start a blog.

3. **Advocate**: Speak up about the issues you care about. Here's how you can do that:

Q5_51_ I am 9 years old and from Slovenia. I know not at all about Citizens’ dialogue, EU Youth Dialogue or EU Youth Conference. Can you tell me more about this? I am very interested in this topic.

Dear friend,

I'm delighted to hear about your interest in the EU Youth Dialogue and Citizens' Dialogue! Let's break down these topics into simpler parts to help you understand them better.

1. **EU (European Union)**: The EU is a group of 27 countries in Europe that work together to make decisions about many aspects of life, like trade, travel, and environmental protection. This includes your country, Slovenia.

2. **Citizens' Dialogue**: Imagine you're having a conversation with your friends about something important, like how to make your school a better place. You all share your ideas, listen to each other, and try to find solutions together. A Citizens' Dialogue is similar, but on a larger scale. It's a conversation between EU citizens and EU leaders about important topics that affect everyone. These dialogues help EU leaders understand what people think and need, and they give citizens a chance to have their say. They can happen in different ways, like public meetings, online discussions, or surveys.

3. **EU Youth Dialogue**: The EU Youth Dialogue is a special part of the Citizens' Dialogue, focused on young people like you. It's a way for the EU to listen to and involve young people in decisions that affect their lives. Here's how it works:

   - **EU Youth Conference**: Every year, young people from all EU countries come together for a conference. They discuss important topics, like education, jobs, or the environment, and share their ideas and concerns with EU leaders. This is a great chance to meet other young people from different countries and learn from each other.

   - **EU Youth Dialogue cycle**: The EU Youth Dialogue happens in a cycle, which means it happens in steps over time. Here's a simple breakdown:

     a. **Consultation**: Young people are asked for their opinions on a specific topic. This can happen through online surveys,
Q5_52_ I am 9 years old and from Slovenia. I know not at all about Public consultations. Can you tell me more about this? I would like to know what is it and how can I participate in it?

Dear friend,

I'm glad you're interested in learning about public consultations! Public consultations are a way for people like you to have a say in decisions that affect your community or country. Here's a simple explanation and some steps on how you can participate:

1. **What are Public Consultations?**
   Public consultations are meetings or events organized by governments, organizations, or companies to gather people's opinions and ideas about a specific topic or plan. They want to know what you think before they make important decisions. This could be about anything from building a new park in your town to changing rules about recycling, or even big issues like how to protect the environment.

2. **Why are they important?**
   Public consultations are important because they give you a chance to share your thoughts and help shape the future. They show that your voice matters and that you can make a difference. They also help the people making decisions to understand different perspectives and make better choices.

3. **How can you participate?**

   a. **Find out about consultations**: Keep an eye out for announcements about public consultations in your local newspaper, on community bulletin boards, or online. You can also ask your parents, teachers, or local officials if they know about any upcoming consultations.

   b. **Understand the topic**: Before you go, make sure you understand what the consultation is about. Ask your parents or teachers to help explain it to you if you're not sure.

   c. **Prepare your thoughts**: Think about what you want to say. It's a good idea to write down your thoughts or practice saying them out loud. Remember, it's okay to ask questions too!

   d. **Attend the consultation**: Go to the meeting with your parents or a trusted adult. Don't be afraid to speak up, but also listen to what other people have to say.

   e. **Fill out surveys
Q5_53_ I am 9 years old and from Slovenia. I know kind of about European elections. Can you tell me more about this? What are they and how do they work?

Dear friend,

I'm delighted to help you understand the European elections! Here's a simple explanation:

1. **What are European Elections?**
   European elections are a way for citizens of the European Union (EU) to choose who will represent them in the European Parliament. The European Parliament is like the EU's assembly, where members (MEPs) from all EU countries come together to make decisions about EU laws and policies.

2. **Why are they important?**
   The European Parliament has several important roles. It:
   - Makes laws for the EU, together with the Council of the EU (which represents the governments of EU countries).
   - Approves or rejects the European Commission (the EU's executive body, like a government).
   - Monitors how EU laws are applied and ensures that the EU institutions are acting democratically.

3. **How do they work?**
   - **Voting System**: Each EU country has a different number of MEPs, depending on its population. In total, there are 705 MEPs. You can vote for a political party or an individual candidate. The votes are counted, and seats in the European Parliament are allocated to each party based on their share of the votes. Then, the parties choose their MEPs from the candidates they put forward.
   - **Elections**: European elections happen every 5 years. The next ones are scheduled for 2024. In some countries, like yours, Slovenia, voting is compulsory.
   - **Election Day**: On election day, you go to a polling station and cast your vote. You can vote for a political party or a specific candidate. The votes are counted, and the results are announced.

4. **Who can vote?**
   - EU citizens who are at least 18 years old (the voting age varies slightly between countries) can vote in the European elections in their home country.

   - The portal is available in all EU languages, including Slovenian.

2. **EU40 (https://www.eu40.org/)**

   - They organize events, workshops, and webinars on various EU-related topics. While you might not be able to participate in all events due to your age, you can follow their activities and learn from their content.

3. **EU Social Media Channels**
   - **Facebook**: The EU has official pages in several languages, including English (https://www.facebook.com/EUinmyregion/), French (https://www.facebook.com/UEenregion/), and German (https://www.facebook.com/EUinmyregionDE/).

Hello! I'm glad to hear that you're interested in learning more about the European Union (EU) and its institutions. The EU is a political and economic union of 27 member states that are primarily located in Europe. It has several institutions that help it function and make decisions. Here are the main EU institutions and their roles:

1. **European Parliament (EP)**: This is the only directly elected EU institution. Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) are elected every five years by EU citizens. The EP has several important roles:

   - It has the power to approve or reject international agreements made by the EU.

2. **Council of the European Union (Council)**: The Council represents the governments of the EU member states. It is composed of ministers from each member state, depending on the policy area being discussed (e.g., finance ministers, agriculture ministers, etc.). The Council's main tasks include:
   - Making laws together with the European Parliament.
   - Coordinating member states' policies.
   - Approving the EU's budget.

It's wonderful to hear that you're interested in participating in events organized by the European Union (EU) in your country, Slovenia.

Here are some ways you can participate:

The EYE is organized every two years, and it's open to young people aged 16-30.

You can find more information on the European Youth Portal: https://europa.eu/youth/what_you_can_do/events/european_youth_event_en

Q5_59_ I am 9 years old and from Slovenia. I know not at all about European Citizens’ Initiative. Can you tell me more about this? What is it and how can I participate?

Dear friend,

I'm glad you're interested in learning about the European Citizens' Initiative (ECI)! It's a great way for citizens like you to have a say in the European Union's policies. Here's a simple explanation:

1. **What is the European Citizens' Initiative?**
   The ECI is a tool that allows citizens of the EU to call on the European Commission to propose new laws. It's a way for your voice to be heard at the European level. The ECI was introduced in 2012 to give EU citizens a direct say in EU policy-making.

2. **How does it work?**
   - **Collecting signatures**: To start an ECI, you need to collect signatures from at least one million EU citizens from at least seven different EU countries. These signatures must be collected within one year.
   - **Review**: Once the signatures are collected, the European Commission reviews the proposal. If it's relevant for EU action and falls within the Commission's competences, the Commission will decide whether to take action.
   - **Next steps**: If the Commission decides not to take action, it must explain why. If it decides to take action, it can propose a legal act to the European Parliament and the Council of the EU.

3. **How can you participate?**
   - **Support an ECI**: You can support an ECI by signing it if you agree with its aims. You can find ECIs on the European Commission's website. Remember, you need to be an EU citizen and resident in an EU country to sign.
   - **Start an ECI**: If you're 18 or older, you can also start your own ECI. You'll need to form a citizens' committee with other EU citizens and follow the rules set out by the European Commission.

4. **Why is it important?**
   The ECI is important because it gives EU
