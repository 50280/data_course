Q5_52_ I am 9 years old and from Malta. I know not at all about Public consultations. Can you tell me more about this? I would like to know what is a public consultation and how can I participate in one?

A public consultation is a process where organizations, governments, or other bodies ask for the public's opinion on a certain topic or issue. This could be about a new policy, a change in a service, or a new project. The goal is to gather different perspectives and ideas from the public to help make better decisions.

Here's how you can participate in a public consultation:

1. **Find out about consultations**: Keep an eye out for announcements about public consultations. They can be found on websites of local councils, government departments, or other organizations. Sometimes, they might also be advertised in local newspapers or on social media.

2. **Understand the topic**: Once you've found a consultation that interests you, make sure you understand what it's about. Read the information provided carefully. If you're still unsure, you can ask for help from an adult or someone who understands the topic well.

3. **Prepare your response**: Think about what you want to say. It's important to be clear and concise. You can write down your thoughts or even draw pictures if that's easier for you.

4. **Submit your response**: Most consultations allow you to submit your response online. Some might also provide paper forms or allow you to send your response by email or post. Make sure to submit your response before the deadline.

5. **Spread the word**: If you think others might be interested in the consultation, tell them about it. You can share the information on social media, tell your friends, or even talk to your teacher about it.

6. **Find out what happens next**: After the consultation has closed, find out what happens to the responses. Sometimes, organizations will publish a summary of the responses or even write back to you to explain how your feedback has been used.

Remember, your voice is important and it's great that you want to get involved in these processes. If you
Q5_53_ I am 9 years old and from Malta. I know a little about European elections. Can you tell me more about this? What are they and why are they important?

Dear 9-year-old,

I'm delighted to help you understand the European elections! Let's break it down into simple parts:

1. **What are European elections?**
   Imagine you have a big school, and you want to choose some students to represent you and make decisions for the whole school. These students would be like the Members of the European Parliament (MEPs). European elections are like your school election, but on a much larger scale, involving the whole European Union (EU), which has 27 member countries.

   Every 5 years, voters in each EU country go to the polls to elect MEPs. These MEPs then gather in the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France, to represent their countries and make decisions that affect the entire EU.

2. **Why are European elections important?**
   European elections are important for several reasons:

   - **Making laws**: The European Parliament, along with the Council of the EU, makes new laws that apply to all EU countries. These laws can affect many aspects of our lives, like how we travel, what we eat, and how we protect the environment.

   - **Choosing the European Commission President**: After the European elections, the European Council (which is made up of the heads of state or government of EU countries) proposes a candidate for the President of the European Commission. The European Parliament then votes on this candidate. The President of the European Commission is like the prime minister of the EU, leading the European Commission, which is the executive branch of the EU.

   - **Having a say in how the EU is run**: By voting in European elections, you and other citizens get to have a say in who represents you and how the EU is run. This is an important part of democracy.

   - **Shaping the future of Europe**: The decisions made by the European Parliament can shape the future of the EU and its citizens. By voting, you can help

Dear 9-year-old,

It's wonderful to hear that you're interested in learning more about the European Union (EU) and how it works! The EU is a group of 27 countries that work together to make decisions and policies that affect their citizens. Here's a simple breakdown and some resources to help you understand it better:

1. **EU Institutions**: Imagine the EU as a big school. The students are the citizens, and the teachers are the EU institutions. Some of the main institutions are:
   - **European Parliament**: This is like the student council. It represents the citizens and makes laws together with the Council of the EU.
   - **Council of the EU**: This is like the headmaster's office. It represents the governments of the EU countries and makes decisions together with the European Parliament.
   - **European Commission**: This is like the school principal. It proposes new laws, runs the day-to-day business of the EU, and makes sure EU countries follow the rules.
   - **European Council**: This is like a meeting of all the teachers. It's made up of the heads of state or government of the EU countries and sets the EU's political agenda.

2. **EU Social Media Channels and Websites**: The EU has several online platforms where you can learn more about it and engage with other young people. Here are a few:

   - **European Youth Portal**: This is a great place for young people like you to find information about studying, working, and volunteering in Europe. You can also find out about youth-related EU policies and initiatives. (https://europa.eu/youth/)

1. **European Commission**: This is the executive branch of the EU. It proposes new laws, manages the day-to-day business of the EU, and makes sure that EU laws are enforced. The Commission is led by a President and has one Commissioner from each member state.

2. **European Parliament**: This is the only directly elected EU institution. It represents the people of Europe and has the power to pass laws and approve the EU's budget. It's based in Strasbourg, France, but also meets in Brussels, Belgium.

3. **Council of the European Union**: This is where national ministers from each EU country meet to discuss and decide on EU policies. The Council is chaired by a different member state every six months.

4. **European Council**: This is where the heads of state or government of the EU member states, along with its President and the President of the Commission, meet to set the EU's political agenda and take decisions on major issues.

5. **European Court of Justice**: This court ensures that EU law is interpreted and applied correctly. It also settles disputes between EU institutions, member states, and companies or individuals.

6. **European Central Bank (ECB)**: The ECB is responsible for managing the euro, the currency of 19 EU member states. It also helps to keep prices stable in the euro area.

7. **Court of Auditors**: This court checks how EU money is spent and ensures that it is used legally and properly.

Q5_57_ I am 9 years old and from Malta. I know not at all about Contacting a Commissioner or an MEP. Can you tell me more about this? I would like to know how to contact them and what I can ask them.

Dear 9-year-old,

It's wonderful that you're interested in getting involved in European politics! Here's a simple guide on how to contact a Commissioner or a Member of the European Parliament (MEP), and some ideas on what you might ask them.

1. **European Commissioners:**
   - **Who are they?** Commissioners are the members of the European Commission, which is the executive branch of the European Union. They are responsible for proposing and implementing new laws and policies.
   - **How to contact them?** You can find the list of Commissioners and their portfolios (the areas they are responsible for) on the European Commission's website: <https://ec.europa.eu/commission/president/commissioners_en>
   - **Contact details:** Each Commissioner has their own contact page with an email address and sometimes a postal address. You can also reach out to them on social media, if they have an account.
   - **What to ask?** You can ask about any topic related to their portfolio. For example, if you're interested in the environment, you might ask the Commissioner for Environment, Oceans and Fisheries about what the EU is doing to protect endangered animals or reduce plastic waste. Here are some ideas:
     - What is the EU doing to help children like me in other countries?
     - How can I help protect the environment?
     - What are you doing to make sure all children have access to education?
     - How can the EU help make sure everyone has enough food to eat?

2. **Members of the European Parliament (MEPs):**
   - **Who are they?** MEPs are the members of the European Parliament, which is the legislative branch of the EU. They represent EU citizens and have the power to pass laws and approve or reject the European Commission.
   - **How to contact them?** You can find your local MEPs on

Q5_59_ I am 9 years old and from Malta. I know not at all about European Citizens’ Initiative. Can you tell me more about this? I would like to know what it is, how it works and how I can participate.

Dear friend,

I'm delighted to help you understand the European Citizens' Initiative (ECI) in a simple and fun way!

1. **What is the European Citizens' Initiative?**
Imagine you have an idea that you think could make Europe a better place. The ECI is like a big suggestion box for the European Union (EU). It's a way for citizens like you to propose new laws or changes to existing ones. It's called an "initiative" because it's something you start or initiate.

2. **How does it work?**
To start an ECI, you need to follow these steps:

   - **Gather support**: You need to find at least one million EU citizens from at least seven different EU countries who support your idea. This is called a "statement of support".

   - **Register your initiative**: Once you have the support, you register your initiative with the European Commission. They check if your idea is legal and falls within the EU's powers.

   - **Collect signatures**: If your initiative is registered, you have one year to collect at least one million signatures from EU citizens. These signatures show that many people support your idea.

   - **The Commission's response**: If you collect enough signatures, the European Commission will have to respond to your initiative. They might propose a new law, change an existing one, or explain why they can't do what you're asking.

3. **How can you participate?**
Even though you're 9 years old, you can still participate in the ECI in a few ways:

   - **Share your ideas**: Talk to your family, friends, and teachers about your ideas for Europe. They might have great suggestions too!

   - **Support other initiatives**: Once you're old enough, you can sign statements of support for ECIs that you believe in. You can also help others collect signatures.
