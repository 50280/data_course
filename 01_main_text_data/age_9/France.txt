5. **Save Energy**: Turn off lights and electronics when you're not using them. Use energy-efficient light bulbs. Consider using public transportation, carpooling, or riding a bike instead of driving to reduce your carbon footprint.

Q3_30_ I am 9 years old and from France. I have never taken part in activities that relate to democratic participation because I don’t understand the issues enough. For my friends, this is kind of the same. Can you tell me more about how I can do that? Thank you.

Dear friend,

It's wonderful that you're interested in democratic participation and want to learn more about how you can get involved. Here are some ways you can start engaging in democratic activities, even at your age:

1. **Learn about democracy**: Start by understanding what democracy is and how it works. You can read books, watch educational videos, or talk to your parents, teachers, or librarians about it. Some recommended books for your age include "Democracy is a Garden" by George Ancona and "If I Ran for President" by Catherine Stier.

2. **School activities**: Participate in school activities that promote democratic values, such as:
   - **Student Council**: If your school has a student council, consider running for a position or supporting your peers who do. This will give you a taste of how elections work and help you develop leadership skills.
   - **Classroom discussions**: Participate in class discussions about current events, social issues, or topics you're learning about. This will help you develop critical thinking and communication skills, which are essential for democratic participation.
   - **School projects**: Join or initiate school projects that focus on community service, environmental conservation, or other issues that matter to you. This will help you understand the importance of collective action and working together for the common good.

3. **Community involvement**: Look for opportunities to get involved in your local community, such as:
   - **Youth clubs or organizations**: Join local youth clubs or organizations that focus on issues you care about, like sports, arts, or environmental conservation. These groups often provide opportunities for young people to develop leadership skills and make a difference in their communities.
   - **Volunteering**: Look for volunteer opportunities in your community, such as helping at a local animal shelter, participating in community clean-up events, or assisting with events at a community center. This will help you understand the importance of civic engagement and giving back to your community.

Q3_31_ I am 9 years old and from France. I have never taken part in activities that relate to democratic participation because Nobody has ever asked or invited me to take part. For my friends, this is not at all the same. Can you tell me more about how I can do that? Thank you.

Dear friend,

It's wonderful to hear from you and to know that you're interested in democratic participation! Even though you might not have had many opportunities yet, there are still plenty of ways for you to get involved and make your voice heard. Here are some ideas:

1. **School Council or Student Government**: If your school has a student council or government, consider running for a position or joining a committee. This is a great way to learn about decision-making processes and to represent your peers' views.

2. **Community Events**: Keep an eye out for community events or initiatives in your area. These could be anything from local environmental clean-up projects to community garden planning meetings. Attending and participating in these events can help you understand how your community works and how you can contribute to it.

3. **Youth Parliaments or Mock UN**: These are organizations that simulate the workings of a parliament or the United Nations. They can provide a great opportunity to learn about international relations, diplomacy, and public speaking. You can often find these in larger cities or through international organizations.

4. **Online Platforms**: There are many online platforms where you can voice your opinion and participate in discussions. Websites like Kids.gov, DoSomething.org, or local government websites often have sections for young people to get involved.

5. **Write Letters or Petitions**: If there's an issue you care about, consider writing a letter to your local representative or starting a petition. This can help you learn about the legislative process and how to advocate for change.

6. **Join a Club or Group**: If there's a cause you're passionate about, like the environment, animals, or social justice, consider joining a club or group that focuses on that issue. This can provide a supportive community where you can learn and take action together.

7. **Talk to Your Family and Friends**: Discuss your thoughts and ideas with your family and friends. They can provide support, encouragement
Q3_32_ I am 9 years old and from France. I have never taken part in activities that relate to democratic participation because I did not know that I could do this. For my friends, this is a little the same. Can you tell me more about how I can do that? Thank you.

Dear friend,

It's wonderful to hear that you're interested in democratic participation! Even at your age, there are many ways you can get involved and make your voice heard. Here are some ideas:

4. **Petitions**: If there's an issue you care about, you could start a petition. Websites like Change.org make it easy for anyone to start a petition. You'll need an adult to help you with this, but it's a great way to gather support for a cause.

5. **Volunteer**: Volunteering is a great way to get involved in your community and make a difference. You could help out at a local charity, participate in community clean-up events, or help with fundraising for a cause you believe in.

6. **Join a Club or Group**: There might be clubs or groups in your school or community that focus on issues you care about, like environmental protection, animal welfare, or social justice. Joining one of these can help you connect with like-minded people and take action together.

Q4b_41_ I am 9 years old and from France. I am a little interested in changing society in the area of Climate change and environmental protection. Can you tell me how I can do this? Thank you.

Hello! It's wonderful to hear that you're interested in making a difference in the area of climate change and environmental protection at such a young age. Here are some ways you can get involved and make a positive impact:

1. **Educate Yourself**: Learn more about climate change, its causes, and effects. This will help you understand the issues better and inspire you to take action. You can read books, watch documentaries, or explore reliable websites to gain knowledge.

2. **Spread Awareness**: Share what you've learned with your friends, family, and classmates. You can organize a small presentation or create posters to educate others. The more people know about the issue, the more likely they are to care and take action.

3. **Start a Club or Group**: If there's an environmental club at your school, join it. If not, consider starting one. You can also create a group with your friends or neighbors to organize local activities.

4. **Reduce, Reuse, Recycle**: Practice the three Rs in your daily life. Reduce your waste by using reusable bags, bottles, and containers. Reuse items as much as possible, and recycle what you can't reuse.

5. **Plant Trees**: Trees absorb carbon dioxide, so planting more of them can help reduce the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. You can start a small garden at home or participate in local tree-planting events.

6. **Save Energy**: Turn off lights and electronics when you're not using them. Use energy-efficient light bulbs and appliances. Encourage your family to do the same.

7. **Protect Wildlife**: Create a safe space for local wildlife in your backyard or neighborhood. You can build birdhouses, create a small pond, or plant native plants that provide food and shelter for local animals.

8. **Write Letters**: Write letters to your local politicians, expressing your concerns about climate change and asking them to support policies

Q5_51_ I am 9 years old and from France. I know not at all about Citizens’ dialogue, EU Youth Dialogue or EU Youth Conference. Can you tell me more about this? I am very interested in this.

Dear friend,

I'm delighted to hear about your interest in the EU Youth Dialogue and the EU Youth Conference! Let's break down these concepts into simpler parts to help you understand them better.

1. **EU (European Union)**: The EU is a group of 27 countries in Europe that work together to make decisions about many aspects of life, like trade, travel, and environmental protection. This helps to make things fairer and easier for people living in these countries.

2. **Citizens' Dialogue**: Imagine you're having a conversation with your friends about something you all care about, like your favorite game or a book you've read. A Citizens' Dialogue is similar, but on a larger scale. It's a conversation between EU citizens and EU leaders about important topics that affect our lives. These can be things like the environment, education, or the future of Europe. The goal is to listen to each other's ideas and opinions, and to understand different points of view.

3. **EU Youth Dialogue**: The EU Youth Dialogue is a special kind of Citizens' Dialogue, just for young people like you! It's a way for young Europeans to have their say about issues that matter to them. The EU wants to hear your ideas and opinions about things like education, jobs, and what kind of future you want to see. This helps the EU make decisions that are better for young people.

4. **EU Youth Conference**: The EU Youth Conference is a big event where young people from all over Europe come together to talk about the EU Youth Dialogue. It's a chance to meet other young people from different countries, share your ideas, and learn from each other. The EU Youth Conference helps to bring the EU Youth Dialogue to life and makes sure that young people's voices are heard.

So, in simple terms, the EU Youth Dialogue is a way for young people to talk to the EU about things
Q5_52_ I am 9 years old and from France. I know not at all about Public consultations. Can you tell me more about this? Thank you.

Hello! It's great to hear from you and I'm excited to help you learn about public consultations. Public consultations are a way for people to share their thoughts, ideas, and concerns about important decisions that affect their community or country. Here are some simple steps to understand how they work:

1. **What is a public consultation?**
   Imagine you're in a big classroom, and the teacher wants to make some changes, like adding a new game during recess or changing the lunch menu. Before making these changes, the teacher wants to know what you and your classmates think. So, they ask for your opinions. That's similar to a public consultation, but instead of a classroom, it's a whole community or country, and instead of a teacher, it's a government, organization, or company making decisions.

2. **Why are public consultations important?**
   Public consultations are important because they give everyone a chance to have a say in decisions that affect them. This helps to make sure that the decisions are fair, and that they take into account the needs and wishes of the people who will be affected by them. It's like having a vote, but instead of just choosing between two options, you can share your ideas and thoughts.

3. **How do public consultations work?**
   Public consultations usually happen in a few different ways:

   - **Online surveys or questionnaires**: You can fill out a form on a website to share your thoughts. This is like raising your hand in class to answer a question, but you can do it from anywhere and at any time.

   - **Public meetings**: Sometimes, there are meetings where you can go and talk to the people making the decisions. It's like having a conversation with your teacher about the changes they want to make. You can ask questions, share your ideas, and listen to what other people have to say.

   - **Written submissions**: You can write a letter or an email to share your thoughts

Q5_55_ I am 9 years old and from France. I know not at all about Visit of the EU institutions. Can you tell me more about this? Thank you.

The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of 27 member states that are primarily located in Europe. The EU has several institutions that help it function and make decisions. Here are some of the main ones and their roles:

1. **European Parliament**: This is the only directly elected EU institution. It represents the people of Europe and has the power to pass laws and approve the EU's budget. It's based in Strasbourg, France, but also holds meetings in Brussels, Belgium.

2. **Council of the European Union**: This is where national ministers from each EU country meet to discuss and decide on EU policies. The Council is based in Brussels, and the presidency of the Council rotates among the member states every six months.

3. **European Commission**: This is the executive body of the EU. It proposes new laws, manages the day-to-day business of the EU, and makes sure that EU laws are enforced. The Commission is based in Brussels and is led by a President and several Commissioners.

4. **European Council**: This is where the heads of state or government of the EU member states, along with the President of the European Commission and the President of the European Council, meet to set the EU's political agenda and provide the necessary impetus for EU integration. It's based in Brussels.

5. **European Court of Justice**: This is the highest court in the EU. It makes sure that EU law is interpreted and applied correctly. It's based in Luxembourg.

6. **European Central Bank (ECB)**: This is responsible for managing the euro, the currency of 19 EU member states. It's based in Frankfurt, Germany.

Each of these institutions plays a crucial role in the functioning of the EU, and they work together to ensure that the EU operates smoothly and effectively.
Q5_56_ I am 9 years old and from France. I know not at all about The European Youth Week or the European Youth Event. Can you tell me more about this? Thank you.

The European Youth Week and the European Youth Event are initiatives organized by the European Union (EU) to engage young people in the democratic life of Europe. Here's a simple breakdown for you:

1. **European Youth Week (EYW)**: This is an annual event that takes place in early May. It's a week-long celebration of youth and youth work across Europe. During this week, various activities and events are organized in different EU countries to showcase the work of young people and youth organizations. These activities can include workshops, debates, cultural events, and more. The goal is to raise awareness about the importance of youth participation in society and to encourage young people to get involved in their communities.

2. **European Youth Event (EYE)**: This is a larger, biennial event that takes place in the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France. The next EYE will be held in May 2023. It's a unique opportunity for young people from all over Europe to come together, share their ideas, and discuss topics that matter to them with decision-makers.

It's a great way for young people to have their voices heard and to learn about how the EU works.

Q5_57_ I am 9 years old and from France. I know not at all about Contacting a Commissioner or an MEP. Can you tell me more about this? I would like to know how to contact them and what I can ask them.

Thank you for your help.

Dear friend,

I'm glad to help you understand how to contact a Commissioner or a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) and what you can ask them.

1. **European Commissioners:**
   - **Who are they?** Commissioners are the members of the European Commission, which is the executive branch of the European Union (EU). They are responsible for proposing new laws and policies to the European Parliament and the Council of the EU.
   - **How to contact them?** You can find the list of Commissioners and their portfolios (the areas they are responsible for) on the European Commission's website: https://ec.europa.eu/commission/president/commissioners_en. Each Commissioner has their own contact page where you can send them a message. You can also write to them in your own language.
   - **What can you ask them?** You can ask them about EU policies and laws related to their portfolio. For example, if you're interested in environmental issues, you might want to contact the Commissioner for Environment, Oceans and Fisheries. You can ask them about what the EU is doing to protect the environment, or suggest ideas for new policies.

Dear friend,

It's wonderful to hear from you and I'm excited to help you learn more about participating in events organized by the European Union (EU) in your country, France. The EU offers a variety of events and initiatives that are open to citizens, especially young people like you, to engage, learn, and participate in the democratic process. Here are some ways you can get involved:

1. **EUROPEAN YOUTH EVENT (EYE)**: This is a unique opportunity for young Europeans to meet and share their ideas on the future of Europe. The EYE is organized every two years, and it's a great platform to discuss topics that matter to you, such as education, environment, or digitalization. You can apply to participate or even become a volunteer. For more information, visit the official EYE website: https://europa.eu/youth/eye_en

2. **EUROPEAN YOUTH PARLIAMENT (EYP)**: The EYP is a program that brings together young people from all over Europe to debate and learn about the EU and its institutions. It's a great way to develop your public speaking, teamwork, and leadership skills. You can participate in local, regional, or even international sessions. To find out more, visit the EYP website: https://www.eyp.org/

3. **EUROPEAN VOLUNTEER SERVICE (EVS)**: If you're interested in volunteering, the EVS is a fantastic opportunity to gain experience abroad while making a positive impact. You can volunteer in various fields, such as environmental protection, social care, or cultural heritage. Keep in mind that you need to be at least 17 years old to participate.

Q5_59_ I am 9 years old and from France. I know not at all about European Citizens’ Initiative. Can you tell me more about this? What is it? What is it for? Who can do it? How can I do it?

Hello! It's great to hear that you're interested in learning about the European Citizens' Initiative (ECI). I'll do my best to explain it in a way that's easy to understand.

1. **What is the European Citizens' Initiative (ECI)?**
The ECI is a unique tool for citizens of the European Union (EU) to participate directly in the EU's democratic life. It allows you to call on the European Commission, which is the executive body of the EU, to propose new laws or changes to existing ones.

2. **What is it for?**
The ECI is for bringing important issues to the attention of the European Commission. If a proposal gathers at least one million signatures from EU citizens, the Commission has to examine it and decide whether to take action. This could mean proposing new laws, changing existing ones, or even deciding not to act if the proposal isn't in line with EU law or policies.

3. **Who can do it?**
To start an ECI, you need to be a citizen of the EU and have at least seven other EU citizens from at least seven different EU countries support you. These people are called the "committee of supporters". They help you with the ECI and make sure it's carried out properly.

4. **How can I do it?**
Since you're 9 years old, you're not yet eligible to start an ECI yourself, as you need to be at least 18 years old. However, you can still participate in an ECI that's already underway. Here's how:

   - **Find an ECI**: You can look for ECIs on the European Commission's website. They have a list of all the ECIs that are currently open for signatures.

   - **Check if you're eligible**: To sign an ECI, you need to be an EU
