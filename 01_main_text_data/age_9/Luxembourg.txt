Dear 9-year-old,

It's wonderful to hear that you're already thinking about how to make a difference in the world. You're right, there are many ways to make your voice heard beyond just contacting a politician. Here are some suggestions tailored to your age and abilities:

1. **Write Letters or Emails**: You can write letters or emails to local newspapers, magazines, or websites to express your opinions. You can also write to companies to share your thoughts about their products or services. Some newspapers have special sections for young writers.

2. **Start a Petition**: Websites like Change.org allow people of all ages to start petitions on issues they care about. You can gather signatures from friends, family, and others to show support for your cause.

3. **Create Art or Media**: Use your creativity to raise awareness about issues you care about. This could be through drawing, painting, writing stories, making videos, or even creating a podcast. You can share your work on social media, in local newspapers, or at school.

4. **Organize a Fundraiser or Event**: You can organize a fundraiser for a cause you believe in, like a bake sale, car wash, or sponsored silence. You could also organize an event to raise awareness, like a march, protest, or community meeting.

Thank you for your question. It's wonderful to see that you're already thinking about how to make a positive impact on the world at such a young age. Here are some ways you can help the environment and animals:

1. **Educate Others**: Share your knowledge about environmental issues and animal welfare with your friends, family, and classmates. You can create posters, give presentations, or start a club at your school to raise awareness.

2. **Reduce, Reuse, Recycle**: Practice the three R's in your daily life. Reduce waste by using reusable bags, bottles, and containers. Reuse items as much as possible, and recycle what you can't reuse.

3. **Plant Trees**: Trees absorb carbon dioxide, which helps combat climate change. You can plant trees in your backyard, a local park, or participate in a community tree-planting event.

4. **Conserve Water**: Turn off the tap while brushing your teeth or washing your hands. Fix any leaks in your home's plumbing. Collect rainwater to water your plants.

6. **Protect Wildlife**: Create a safe space for wildlife in your backyard by installing bird feeders, birdhouses, or bat boxes. Never litter, as it can harm or kill wildlife.

7. **Adopt, Don't Shop**: If you're thinking about getting a pet, consider adopting from a shelter instead of buying from a pet store. This helps reduce the demand for puppy mills and gives a home to an animal in need.

Q3_32_ I am 9 years old and from Luxembourg. I have never taken part in activities that relate to democratic participation because I did not know that I could do this. For my friends, this is not at all the same. Can you tell me more about how I can do that? Thank you.

Dear friend,

It's wonderful to hear that you're interested in democratic participation! Even at your age, there are many ways you can get involved and make your voice heard. Here are some ideas:

1. **School Council or Student Council**: Many schools have a council where students can voice their opinions and ideas. If your school doesn't have one, you could suggest starting one. You could help organize school events, improve the school environment, or suggest changes to make school life better.

2. **Youth Parliament**: Some countries have youth parliaments where young people can learn about democracy and have a say in local or national issues. In Luxembourg, there's the "Jeunesses Socialistes" and "Jeunesses Chrétiennes Sociales" which are youth organizations that engage in political activities.

3. **Community Service**: Participating in community service projects can help you understand the needs of your community and how you can contribute to making it a better place. This could be anything from helping at a local charity, cleaning up a park, or organizing a community event.

4. **Online Petitions and Surveys**: Websites like Change.org allow you to start or sign petitions on issues you care about. You can also participate in surveys and polls to share your opinion on various topics.

5. **Write to Your Elected Representatives**: You can write letters or emails to your local politicians, members of parliament, or even the Prime Minister to share your thoughts and ideas. They represent you, so it's important for them to hear your voice.

6. **Join a Club or Group**: Joining a club or group that focuses on an issue you care about can be a great way to learn more and make a difference. This could be anything from an environmental group, a sports team, or a group that focuses on social issues.

7. **Educate Yourself**: The more you know about how democracy works and the issues that affect your community and
Q3_33_ I am 9 years old and from Luxembourg. I have never taken part in activities that relate to democratic participation because These activities are too far away. It is difficult to get there from my home  (e.g. by public transport). For my friends, this is not at all the same. Can you tell me more about how I can do that? I would like to participate in activities that relate to democratic participation.

Dear friend,

It's great to hear that you're interested in democratic participation! There are many ways you can get involved, even if some activities are far away. Here are some suggestions:

1. **Online Activities**: Many organizations now offer online events and activities. This means you can participate from the comfort of your own home. You can find these opportunities on websites of organizations that focus on youth and democracy, such as the European Youth Parliament, the European Youth Forum, or local youth councils.

2. **Local Activities**: Check with your local municipality or youth center to see if they offer any democratic participation activities. These could be closer to home and easier to reach.

3. **School Activities**: Your school might have clubs or groups that focus on democracy, human rights, or social issues. Joining one of these could be a great way to start.

4. **Youth Parliaments**: Some countries have youth parliaments where young people can learn about democracy and have their say on issues that matter to them. Check if there's one in Luxembourg or a neighboring country.

5. **Volunteering**: You could also consider volunteering for a local charity or community organization. This can be a great way to learn about democracy in action and make a difference in your community.

6. **Online Petitions and Surveys**: Websites like Change.org allow you to start or sign petitions on issues you care about. You can also find surveys and polls on various topics that you can participate in.

7. **Social Media**: Follow organizations and individuals who are working on issues you care about. This can help you stay informed and find out about opportunities to get involved.

8. **Write to Your Representatives**: You can write letters or emails to your local representatives to share your thoughts on issues that matter to you. This is a simple but powerful way to participate in democracy.

Q4b_43_ I am 9 years old and from Luxembourg. I am a little interested in changing society in the area of Economic inequality and welfare expenditure. Can you tell me how I can do this? I want to do something that will make a difference.

Thank you for your question. It's wonderful to see that you're already thinking about how to make a positive impact on society at such a young age. Here are some steps you can take to start making a difference in the areas of economic inequality and welfare expenditure:

1. **Educate Yourself**: Learn more about the issues you're passionate about. Read books, watch documentaries, and talk to people who are knowledgeable about these topics. Some books that might be suitable for your age include "A Long Walk to Water" by Linda Sue Park and "Wonder" by R.J. Palaccio, which touch on themes of inequality and empathy.

2. **Start Small**: You don't have to change the world overnight. Start with small actions in your own community. Here are a few ideas:

   - **Fundraising**: Organize a small fundraising event like a bake sale, a car wash, or a lemonade stand to raise money for a local charity that focuses on poverty or inequality. You could also ask your school if you can organize a non-uniform day where students can pay a small fee to wear their own clothes, with the money going to charity.

   - **Volunteering**: Spend some time volunteering at a local charity or community center. This could be helping out at a food bank, reading to children at a library, or helping with community gardening.

   - **Advocacy**: Write letters to local politicians or the editor of your local newspaper about issues you care about. You could also start a petition or organize a protest (with permission from your parents and following all local guidelines).

3. **Influence Others**: Talk to your friends, family, and classmates about the issues you care about. You might inspire them to take action too. You could also start a club at your school focused on social justice issues.

4. **Use Your Voice**: Speak up when you see something
Q4b_44_ I am 9 years old and from Luxembourg. I am kind of interested in changing society in the area of Equal rights regardless of gender, race or sexuality. Can you tell me how I can do this? I want to do something that will make a difference.

Thank you for your question. It's wonderful to see someone so young already thinking about making a positive impact on society. Here are some steps you can take to start making a difference in the area of equal rights:

1. **Educate Yourself**: Learn about different forms of discrimination, the history of the fight for equal rights, and the current issues surrounding this topic. This will help you understand the problems and how you can contribute to solving them.

2. **Talk to Others**: Discuss these issues with your family, friends, and teachers. You can start conversations about why everyone deserves to be treated equally, regardless of their gender, race, or sexuality. You can also ask them about their thoughts and experiences.

3. **Read Books and Watch Movies**: There are many children's books and movies that talk about diversity, equality, and inclusion. These can help you understand these topics better and also teach you how to be an ally.

4. **Start a Club or Group**: If your school doesn't have a club focused on equality, you could start one. You can invite friends and classmates to join and together, you can plan activities and events to raise awareness about these issues.

5. **Participate in Community Events**: Look for local events that support equality, such as pride parades, women's marches, or cultural festivals. Participating in these events can help you feel more connected to the community and show your support for equal rights.

6. **Write Letters or Start a Blog**: You can write letters to local politicians, newspaper editors, or other influential people to express your views on equality. You could also start a blog or a social media account to share your thoughts and ideas with a wider audience.

7. **Fundraise**: You can organize fundraisers to support organizations that work for equal rights. This could be anything from a bake sale to a sponsored silence or a charity run.

   - The European Youth Parliament
   - The Luxembourgish Youth Council (Conseil de la Jeunesse)

   - **European Youth Week (EYW)**: This is a week-long event held annually in early May.

   - **European Youth Event (EYE)**: This is a larger, more centralized event held every two years in Strasbourg, France, where the European Parliament is based. It's a chance for young people to meet and discuss with decision-makers, learn about the European Union, and participate in workshops, debates, and cultural activities.

2. **What is the purpose?**
   - Both events aim to:
     - Encourage young people to participate in democratic life and express their opinions on issues that affect them.
     - Foster a sense of European citizenship and belonging.
     - Provide a platform for young people to share their ideas and experiences with each other and with decision-makers.
     - Promote active citizenship, human rights, and democracy.

3. **What can you do?**

Q5_59_ I am 9 years old and from Luxembourg. I know a little about European Citizens’ Initiative. Can you tell me more about this? What is it and how does it work?

Hello! It's great to hear that you're interested in learning about the European Citizens’ Initiative (ECI). I'll do my best to explain it in a way that's easy to understand.

The European Citizens’ Initiative is a unique tool that allows citizens of the European Union (EU) to participate directly in the EU's democratic life. It was introduced in 2012 as part of the Treaty of Lisbon, which is a big agreement between the EU countries about how the EU should work.

Here's how it works:

1. **Who can start an ECI?**
   - At least 7 EU citizens from at least 7 different EU countries can start an ECI. They need to form a citizens' committee and register their initiative with the European Commission.

2. **What can an ECI be about?**
   - An ECI can be about changing or creating new EU laws. However, it can't be about things that are already covered by the EU treaties, like the EU's budget or foreign policy.

3. **Gathering signatures:**
   - Once an ECI is registered, the citizens' committee has one year to gather at least 1 million signatures from EU citizens. These signatures must come from at least 7 different EU countries, and the number of signatures from each country must be proportional to the size of that country's population.

4. **What happens after the signatures are gathered?**
   - If the ECI gathers enough signatures, the European Commission will examine the initiative and decide whether to propose new legislation based on the ECI's demands. The Commission isn't obliged to propose new legislation, but it has to explain its decision to the European Parliament and the Council of the EU.

5. **Following up on the ECI:**
   - After the Commission has decided what to do with the ECI, the citizens' committee can follow up on the initiative by submitting a request
