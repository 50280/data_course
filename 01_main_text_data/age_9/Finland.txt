Q5_51_ I am 9 years old and from Finland. I know not at all about Citizens’ dialogue, EU Youth Dialogue or EU Youth Conference. Can you tell me more about this? I am interested in this topic.

Dear friend,

I'm delighted to hear about your interest in the EU Youth Dialogue and the Citizens' Dialogue! Let's break down these topics into simpler parts to help you understand them better.

1. **EU (European Union)**: The EU is a group of 27 countries in Europe that work together to make decisions about many aspects of life, like trade, travel, and environmental protection. This helps to make life easier and more fair for people living in these countries.

2. **Citizens' Dialogue**: Imagine you're having a conversation with your friends about something you all care about, like your favorite game or a book you've read. Now, imagine that conversation happening on a bigger scale, with people from different countries, and the topic is about how to make the EU a better place. That's what a Citizens' Dialogue is! It's a way for EU citizens to share their ideas and concerns with each other and with EU leaders. These dialogues can happen in many forms, like public events, online discussions, or even through written contributions.

3. **EU Youth Dialogue**: The EU Youth Dialogue is a special part of the Citizens' Dialogue, focused on young people like you! It's a way for young Europeans to have their say about issues that matter to them. The EU Youth Dialogue helps to make sure that young people's voices are heard when decisions are being made about their future. It's a great opportunity to share your ideas, ask questions, and learn from other young people across Europe.

4. **EU Youth Conference**: The EU Youth Conference is the final event of the EU Youth Dialogue. It's like a big meeting where young people from all over Europe come together to discuss the most important topics they've identified during the EU Youth Dialogue. They share their ideas, vote on priorities, and create a list of recommendations for EU leaders. These recommendations can help shape EU policies and make
Q5_52_ I am 9 years old and from Finland. I know not at all about Public consultations. Can you tell me more about this? What is it?

Public consultations are a way for people to share their thoughts, ideas, and concerns about important decisions that affect their lives. These decisions could be about things like new laws, changes to services, or big projects in your community. Here's a simple breakdown:

1. **Who organizes them?** Governments, local councils, or organizations that are planning something big often organize public consultations.

2. **Why are they important?** Public consultations are important because they give everyone a chance to have a say in what happens in their community. This helps to make sure that decisions are fair and take into account the needs and wishes of different people.

3. **How do they work?** Public consultations can happen in different ways. Sometimes, there are meetings where you can talk to people in charge and share your thoughts. Other times, there might be online surveys or questionnaires where you can fill in your ideas. Some consultations might also involve exhibitions or displays where you can see plans and give your feedback.

4. **Who can take part?** Anyone can take part in a public consultation, as long as they are old enough to have an opinion. In some places, you might need to be a certain age, like 16 or 18, to officially take part. But even if you're younger, your voice is still important and you can share your thoughts.

5. **What happens to the feedback?** After the consultation, all the feedback is collected and looked at. This helps the people making the decision to understand what people think and want. It might not always be possible to do exactly what everyone wants, but the feedback is always taken into account.

So, in simple terms, a public consultation is like a big conversation where everyone can have their say about important things that affect their lives. It's a way to make sure that decisions are fair and take into account what lots of different people think.

Q5_58_ I am 9 years old and from Finland. I know not at all about Participation in events organised by the EU in your country. Can you tell me more about this? I am interested in this topic.

Participation in events organised by the EU in your country can be a great way to learn more about the European Union, its values, and how it works. Here are some ways you can participate:

1. **EU Information Days and Events**: The EU often organises information days and events in member countries to explain EU policies, programmes, and funding opportunities. These events are open to the public and can be a great way to learn more about the EU. You can find out about these events through your local EU office or by checking the EU's official website.

2. **EU Youth Dialogue**: The EU Youth Dialogue is a platform for young people to have their say on issues that matter to them. It's a great way to participate in EU policy-making. You can get involved by joining local discussions, or by participating in online consultations. You can find more information on the EU Youth website.

3. **EU-funded Projects**: Many organisations and institutions in your country receive EU funding to implement projects. These projects often involve activities that you can participate in, such as workshops, seminars, or cultural events. You can find out about these projects through your local EU office or by checking the EU's funding and tenders portal.

4. **EU Competitions and Contests**: The EU often organises competitions and contests for young people, such as the EU's "Europe in My Region" photo competition or the "EU Prize for Literature". These can be a fun way to engage with the EU and show off your skills.

5. **EU Elections**: When you're older, you'll have the chance to participate in EU elections. These elections are an important way to have your say in how the EU is run. You can learn more about how the EU works and how elections are organised by checking the EU's official website.

6. **EU Schools**: Some schools in your country may be part of the EU's "Comenius
Q5_59_ I am 9 years old and from Finland. I know a little about European Citizens’ Initiative. Can you tell me more about this? What is it and how does it work?

Dear friend,

I'm delighted to help you understand the European Citizens’ Initiative (ECI) in a simple and fun way!

Imagine you have a great idea that you think could make Europe a better place. The ECI is like a special way for you and other Europeans to tell the European Commission (that's the group of people who make sure the European Union works well) about your idea. It's like a big, collective letter-writing campaign!

Here's how it works:

1. **Come up with an idea**: You or a group of people think of a good idea that could improve something in Europe. It could be about the environment, health, digital rights, or anything else that affects Europeans.

2. **Gather support**: To show that your idea is important to many people, you need to collect signatures from at least one million Europeans. But here's the cool part: you don't need to collect all those signatures by yourself. You can work with other people and organizations across Europe to reach the goal together.

3. **Follow the rules**: There are some rules you need to follow when collecting signatures. For example, you need to register your ECI with the European Commission, and you can only collect signatures for one year. Also, you need to make sure that the people signing your ECI are European Union citizens.

4. **Hand in your signatures**: Once you've collected at least one million signatures, you hand them in to the European Commission. They will then check if your ECI is valid and if it meets all the rules.

5. **The European Commission responds**: If your ECI is valid, the European Commission will have to respond to your idea. They might decide to take action on your proposal, or they might explain why they can't. Either way, they have to explain their decision to you and all the people who signed your ECI.

So, the ECI is a way
