5. **Create Art or Media**: You can use your creativity to raise awareness about issues you care about. This could be through drawing posters, writing stories, making videos, or creating music.

Thank you for your question. It's wonderful to see that you are already thinking about how to make a positive impact on the world at such a young age. Here are some ways you can help the environment and animals:

2. **Reduce, Reuse, Recycle**: Practice the three R's in your daily life. Reduce waste by using reusable bags, bottles, and containers. Reuse items as much as possible, and recycle what you can't reuse.

3. **Plant Trees**: Trees absorb carbon dioxide, which helps combat climate change. You can plant trees in your backyard, school, or a local park. If you can't plant trees yourself, you can support organizations that do.

4. **Conserve Water**: Turn off the tap while brushing your teeth or washing your hands. Fix any leaks in your home. Collect rainwater to water plants.

5. **Save Energy**: Turn off lights and electronics when you're not using them. Use energy-efficient light bulbs. Consider using public transportation, carpooling, or riding a bike instead of driving to reduce your carbon footprint.

6. **Help Local Wildlife**: Create a bird feeder or a birdbath in your backyard. Plant native plants that attract local wildlife. If you find injured or orphaned animals, contact a local wildlife rehabilitator for help.

7. **Adopt, Don't Shop**: If you want a pet, consider adopting from a shelter instead of buying from a pet store. This helps reduce the demand for puppy mills and gives a home to an animal in need.

Q5_51_ I am 9 years old and from Italy. I know not at all about Citizens’ dialogue, EU Youth Dialogue or EU Youth Conference. Can you tell me more about this? I am very curious to know more about it.

Dear friend,

I'm delighted to help you understand these important initiatives! Let's break them down into simpler parts:

1. **Citizens' Dialogue**: This is a way for European citizens to talk directly with European Commissioners (who are like ministers in the European Union). These dialogues happen all over Europe, and they're a chance for people to ask questions, share their ideas, and discuss the future of Europe. It's like a big conversation where everyone can have their say. The European Commission wants to hear from people like you, so they can understand what's important to you and use that to help shape EU policies.

2. **EU Youth Dialogue**: This is a special part of the Citizens' Dialogue, just for young people like you! It's a way for the European Union to listen to young people's ideas and opinions about the future of Europe. The EU Youth Dialogue happens in two main ways:

   - **National level**: Each country in the EU has its own way of involving young people in the dialogue. This could be through schools, youth organizations, or online platforms. In Italy, for example, there might be meetings or events where you can share your thoughts.

   - **European level**: Every year, there's a big event called the EU Youth Conference, where young people from all over Europe come together to discuss and vote on the most important topics for young people. The results of this conference help shape the EU's policies on youth.

3. **EU Youth Conference**: This is the big event I mentioned earlier. It's a chance for young people from all over Europe to meet, discuss, and vote on the most important topics for young people. The conference is organized by the European Commission, and it's a great way to make your voice heard at a European level. The topics can vary, but they often include things like education, employment, digitalization, and democracy.

So,

Q5_53_ I am 9 years old and from Italy. I know kind of about European elections. Can you tell me more about this? What are they? What do they do? How do they work?

Dear 9-year-old friend from Italy,

I'm delighted to help you understand the European elections! Let's imagine you're in a big school called Europe, where many countries come together to learn and play. The European Union (EU) is like the school's council, which helps make decisions for all the students (countries) to ensure everyone is happy, safe, and treated fairly.

1. **What are European elections?**
   European elections are like choosing the school council representatives. Every five years, people from each EU country vote for their preferred candidates to represent them in the European Parliament. This parliament is like the school council, where elected members discuss and decide on important rules and policies for all the EU countries.

2. **What does the European Parliament do?**
   The European Parliament has several important jobs:
   - **Making laws**: Together with the Council of the EU (which represents the governments of the member countries), the Parliament makes new laws for the EU. These laws can be about many things, like protecting the environment, ensuring fair trade, or keeping people safe.
   - **Controlling the budget**: The Parliament decides how the EU's money should be spent.
   - **Supervising other EU institutions**: The Parliament keeps an eye on other EU institutions to make sure they're working properly and following the rules.
   - **Representing EU citizens**: The Parliament listens to the voices of EU citizens and makes sure their concerns are taken into account when making decisions.

3. **How do European elections work?**
   - **Voting system**: Each EU country has its own voting system. Some countries use a system where you vote for a political party, and others allow you to vote for individual candidates. In some countries, you can even choose both!
   - **Electing MEPs**: The people elected in these elections are called Members of the European Parliament (MEPs

Q5_55_ I am 9 years old and from Italy. I know not at all about Visit of the EU institutions. Can you tell me more about this? Thank you.

The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of 27 member states that are primarily located in Europe. The EU has several institutions that help it function and make decisions. Here are some of the main ones and their roles:

1. **European Parliament**: This is the only directly elected EU institution. It represents the people of Europe and has the power to pass laws and approve the EU's budget. It's based in Strasbourg, France, but also holds meetings in Brussels, Belgium.

2. **Council of the European Union**: This is where national ministers from each EU country meet to discuss and decide on EU policies. The Council is based in Brussels and is chaired by a different country every six months.

3. **European Commission**: This is the EU's executive body. It proposes new laws, manages the day-to-day business of the EU, and makes sure that EU laws are enforced. The Commission is based in Brussels and is led by a President and several Commissioners.

4. **European Council**: This is where the heads of state or government of the EU countries, along with the President of the Commission and the President of the European Parliament, meet to set the EU's political agenda and provide the necessary impetus for EU integration. It's based in Brussels.

5. **European Court of Justice**: This is the highest court in the EU. It makes sure that EU law is interpreted and applied correctly. It's based in Luxembourg.

6. **European Central Bank (ECB)**: This is responsible for managing the euro, the currency of 19 EU countries. It's based in Frankfurt, Germany.

Each of these institutions plays a crucial role in the functioning of the EU, and they work together to ensure that the EU operates smoothly and effectively.

Q5_59_ I am 9 years old and from Italy. I know not at all about European Citizens’ Initiative. Can you tell me more about this? What is it? What can I do with it?

Dear friend,

I'm glad you're interested in learning about the European Citizens' Initiative (ECI)! It's a great way for citizens like you to have a say in the European Union's policies. Let me explain it in a simple way:

1. **What is the European Citizens' Initiative?**
   The ECI is a tool that allows citizens of the European Union to call on the European Commission to propose new laws. It's like a petition, but specifically for EU matters. It was created to give EU citizens a direct say in the EU's decision-making process.

2. **Who can start an ECI?**
   Any EU citizen, or a group of citizens, can start an ECI. They need to be of legal age (18 or older) and have the support of at least one million EU citizens from at least seven different EU countries.

3. **What can you do with an ECI?**
   You can use an ECI to propose a new EU law or ask the Commission to take action on a specific issue. Here are a few examples of ECIs that have been successful in the past:

   - **Right to Water**: This ECI asked the EU to recognize water as a human right and to ensure that water services are public and not privatized. It gathered over 1.8 million signatures and the Commission responded by proposing a new law on water management.

   - **Stop Glyphosate**: This ECI asked the EU to phase out glyphosate, a controversial herbicide, from use in the EU. It gathered over 1.3 million signatures and the Commission took action to restrict the use of glyphosate.

4. **What can you do as a 9-year-old?**
   While you might not be able to start an ECI yourself (as you need to be 18 or older), you can still participate in the process
