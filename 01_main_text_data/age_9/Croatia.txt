Q5_51_ I am 9 years old and from Croatia. I know not at all about Citizens’ dialogue, EU Youth Dialogue or EU Youth Conference. Can you tell me more about this? I am interested in this topic.

Dear friend,

I'm delighted to hear about your interest in the EU Youth Dialogue and Citizens' Dialogue! Let's break down these topics into simpler parts to help you understand them better.

1. **EU (European Union)**: The EU is a group of 27 countries in Europe that work together to make decisions about many aspects of life, like trade, travel, and environmental protection. This includes your country, Croatia, which joined the EU in 2013.

2. **Citizens' Dialogue**: Imagine you're having a conversation with your friends about something important, like how to make your school a better place. You all share your ideas, listen to each other, and try to find solutions together. A Citizens' Dialogue is similar, but on a larger scale. It's a public event where EU officials and local citizens get together to talk about EU policies and how they affect our daily lives. It's a chance for people to ask questions, share their thoughts, and learn more about the EU. These dialogues help the EU understand what's important to its citizens and how it can improve.

3. **EU Youth Dialogue**: Now, imagine you and your friends are having a conversation specifically about things that matter to young people, like education, jobs, or the environment. The EU Youth Dialogue is like that, but for young people across the EU. It's a platform where young people can share their ideas, concerns, and suggestions about topics that affect them. The EU listens to these conversations and uses them to shape policies that can improve the lives of young Europeans.

4. **EU Youth Conference**: The EU Youth Conference is a big event where young people from all over the EU come together to discuss and vote on the most important topics for young Europeans. It's like a big meeting where you and your friends from other countries can share your ideas and make decisions together. The results of the conference are then

Q5_53_ I am 9 years old and from Croatia. I know kind of about European elections. Can you tell me more about this? What are they and how do they work?

Dear friend,

I'm delighted to help you understand the European elections! Here's a simple explanation:

1. **What are European Elections?**
   European elections are a way for citizens of the European Union (EU) to choose who will represent them in the European Parliament. The European Parliament is like the EU's assembly, where members (MEPs) from all EU countries come together to make decisions about EU laws and policies.

2. **Why are they important?**
   The European Parliament has a lot of power. It helps to make and change EU laws, and it also has a say in how the EU's budget is spent. So, the people we elect to the European Parliament can help shape many aspects of our lives, from the environment and trade to travel and technology.

3. **How do they work?**
   - **Voting System**: Each EU country has its own voting system. Some use a system called proportional representation, where seats in the European Parliament are allocated to political parties based on the number of votes they receive. Others use a system similar to the one used for national elections, where voters choose individual candidates.
   - **Election Date**: European elections are held every five years. The next ones are scheduled for May 2024.
   - **Who Can Vote?**: All EU citizens who are at least 18 years old (or 16 in some countries) can vote in European elections. Some countries also allow non-EU citizens who live there to vote, as long as their country of origin allows EU citizens to vote in their national elections.
   - **Who Can Run?**: To run for election, you need to be a citizen of an EU country, at least 18 years old (or 21 in some countries), and meet certain other criteria. You can run as an individual candidate or as part of a political party.

4. **What happens after

The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of 27 member states that are primarily located in Europe. The EU has several institutions that help it function and make decisions. Here are some of the main EU institutions and their roles:

1. **European Commission**: This is the executive branch of the EU. It proposes new laws, manages the day-to-day business of the EU, and makes sure that EU laws are enforced. The Commission is led by a President and has one Commissioner from each member state.

2. **European Parliament**: This is the only directly elected EU institution. It represents the people of Europe and has the power to pass laws and approve the EU's budget. It's based in Strasbourg, France, but also meets in Brussels, Belgium.

3. **Council of the European Union**: This is where national ministers from each EU country meet to discuss and decide on EU policies. The Council is chaired by a different member state every six months.

4. **European Council**: This is where the heads of state or government of the EU member states, along with its President and the President of the Commission, meet to set the EU's political agenda and take decisions on major issues.

5. **European Court of Justice**: This court ensures that EU law is interpreted and applied correctly. It also settles disputes between EU institutions, member states, and companies or individuals.

6. **European Central Bank (ECB)**: The ECB is responsible for managing the euro, the currency of 19 EU member states. It also helps to keep prices stable in the euro area.

7. **Court of Auditors**: This court checks how EU money is spent and ensures that it is used legally and properly.

These institutions work together to make sure the EU runs smoothly and that the interests of all EU citizens are taken into account. They are based in Brussels, Belgium, with the exception of the European Parliament (Strasbourg) and

Dear friend,

It's wonderful to hear that you're interested in learning more about events organized by the European Union (EU) in your country, Croatia. The EU supports a wide range of events and initiatives that aim to bring people together, foster dialogue, and promote European values and cooperation. Here are some types of events and ways you can participate:

1. **EU Information Days and Awareness Campaigns**: The EU Delegation to Croatia often organizes information days and awareness campaigns to promote EU policies, programs, and opportunities. These events can cover various topics such as EU funding, youth programs, environmental protection, or digital innovation. To find out about these events, you can:
   - Visit the EU Delegation to Croatia's website: <https://eeas.europa.eu/delegations/hr>
   - Follow their social media channels (Facebook, Twitter) for updates and announcements.
   - Check local newspapers, radio, and TV stations for event promotions.

2. **EU-funded Projects and Programs**: The EU provides funding for various projects and programs that involve local communities, schools, and youth organizations. Some examples include:

Q5_59_ I am 9 years old and from Croatia. I know not at all about European Citizens’ Initiative. Can you tell me more about this? What is it and how can I participate?

Dear friend,

I'm glad you're interested in learning about the European Citizens' Initiative (ECI)! It's a great way for citizens like you to have a say in the European Union's policies. Here's a simple explanation:

1. **What is the European Citizens' Initiative (ECI)?**
   The ECI is a tool for citizens of the European Union to call on the European Commission to propose new legislation on issues that concern them. It's a way for your voice to be heard at the European level.

2. **How does it work?**
   - To start an ECI, you need to be a citizen of the EU and gather support from at least one million EU citizens from at least seven different EU countries.
   - You'll need to register your ECI with the European Commission, and then you have one year to collect signatures.
   - If you succeed in collecting one million signatures, the European Commission will have to acknowledge your initiative and decide whether to take action. They might propose new legislation, or explain why they won't.

3. **How can you participate?**
   - Since you're 9 years old, you can't start or sign an ECI yourself yet, but you can learn about them and talk to your parents, teachers, or other adults about them.
   - You can also help spread the word about ECIs that you think are important. Maybe you could start a small campaign in your school or neighborhood to raise awareness.
   - When you're older, you'll be able to start or sign ECIs yourself. Remember, every EU citizen has the right to participate in the democratic process.

4. **Where can you find more information?**
   The European Commission has a website dedicated to the ECI where you can find more information and see the ECIs that are currently underway: https://ec.europa.eu/citizens-initiative/public/welcome.do
