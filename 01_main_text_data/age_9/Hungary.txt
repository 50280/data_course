6. **Join a Youth Organization**: There are many international organizations that focus on empowering young people to make a difference. Some examples include UNICEF, Amnesty International, and the World Wildlife Fund.

7. **Plant Trees or Start a Garden**: This is a small but significant way to help the environment. You can also encourage your school or community to do the same.

Q1_5_ I am 9 years old and from Hungary. I think that to make my voice heard Volunteering for a charity/campaign organisation is not at all effective. Can you give me more ways of doing this? I want to help the environment and animals.

Thank you for your question. It's wonderful to see that you're already thinking about how to make a difference in the world at such a young age. Here are some ways you can help the environment and animals:

1. **Educate Others**: Share your knowledge about environmental issues and animal welfare with your friends, family, and classmates. You can create posters, give presentations, or start a club at your school to raise awareness.

2. **Reduce, Reuse, Recycle**: Practice the three R's in your daily life. Reduce waste by using reusable bags, bottles, and containers. Reuse items as much as possible, and recycle what you can't reuse.

3. **Plant Trees**: Trees absorb carbon dioxide, which helps combat climate change. You can plant trees in your backyard, a local park, or participate in a community tree-planting event.

4. **Conserve Water**: Turn off the tap while brushing your teeth or washing your hands. Fix any leaks in your home. Collect rainwater to water your plants.

5. **Save Energy**: Turn off lights and electronics when you're not using them. Use energy-efficient light bulbs. Consider using public transportation, carpooling, or riding a bike instead of driving to reduce your carbon footprint.

6. **Help Local Wildlife**: Create a bird feeder or a birdbath in your backyard. Plant native plants that attract local wildlife. If you find injured or orphaned animals, contact a local wildlife rehabilitator for help.

7. **Adopt, Don't Shop**: If you're thinking about getting a pet, consider adopting from a shelter instead of buying from a pet store. This helps reduce the demand for puppy mills and gives a home to an animal in need.

8. **Participate in Clean-Up Events**: Join local clean-up events to help keep your community clean and safe for both people and animals.

9. **Write

Even if you're too young to join a protest alone, you can ask your parents to take you to one, or you can organize a small protest in your school or neighborhood with your friends.

4. **Volunteer**: Give your time to help causes you believe in. This could be anything from cleaning up a local park to helping out at an animal shelter or a food bank.

For my friends, this is not at all the same. Can you tell me more about how I can do that? What are the benefits of participating in democratic activities?

Dear friend,

It's wonderful to hear that you're interested in learning more about democratic participation! At your age, there are many ways you can start getting involved and understanding the process. Here are some activities and benefits that might help you:

You can talk to your parents, teachers, or other adults to find out more. This will help you understand what democratic participation means in your own backyard.

2. **Join a school club or group**: Many schools have clubs or groups that focus on social issues, environmental concerns, or other topics. Joining one of these can help you learn about these issues and how you can make a difference. If your school doesn't have any, you could start your own!

4. **Express your opinion**: Don't be afraid to share your thoughts and ideas. You can do this at school, at home, or even online (with your parents' permission and guidance). Remember, your voice matters!

Q5_57_ I am 9 years old and from Hungary. I know a lot about Contacting a Commissioner or an MEP. Can you tell me more about this? I want to know more about the European Union and how it works.

Dear young friend,

I'm delighted to hear about your interest in the European Union (EU) and its workings. The EU is a unique political and economic partnership that unites 27 member countries, and it's great that you're taking an interest in it at such a young age. Here's a simplified explanation of how the EU works, focusing on the roles of Commissioners and Members of the European Parliament (MEPs), as you've shown particular interest in these positions.

1. **The European Commission**: The European Commission is the executive branch of the EU, responsible for proposing new laws and ensuring that existing EU laws are enforced. It's led by a President, who is elected by the European Council (the heads of state or government of the EU member countries) and approved by the European Parliament. The Commission is made up of 27 Commissioners, one from each member country. Here's how you can contact a Commissioner:

   - **Online**: You can send an email to the Commissioner's cabinet using the contact form on the European Commission's website. You can find the contact form by clicking on the Commissioner's name on this page: https://ec.europa.eu/commission/president/commissioners_en
   - **Post**: You can also write a letter to the Commissioner at their official address. You can find the address by clicking on the Commissioner's name on the same page mentioned above.

2. **The European Parliament**: The European Parliament is the legislative branch of the EU, responsible for passing EU laws alongside the Council of the EU (representing the member countries). MEPs are elected every five years by EU citizens. Here's how you can contact an MEP:

   - **Online**: Most MEPs have websites where you can find their contact details. You can also use the "Europa" search engine to find an MEP's contact details: https://europa
Q5_58_ I am 9 years old and from Hungary. I know  about Participation in events organised by the EU in your country. Can you tell me more about this? What are the events? What are the benefits of participating in these events? How can I participate in these events?

Dear friend,

It's wonderful to hear that you're interested in learning more about events organized by the European Union (EU) in your country, Hungary. The EU offers a variety of events and initiatives that aim to engage citizens, especially young people, in understanding and shaping the European project. Here are some types of events and their benefits, along with information on how you can participate:

1. **EU Information Days and Citizens' Dialogues**: These events provide information about EU policies, funds, and initiatives. They are opportunities for citizens to learn about the EU's work and engage in discussions with EU officials, national authorities, and other participants. Benefits include:
   - Learning about the EU's impact on your daily life and your country.
   - Understanding how EU funds support local projects and initiatives.
   - Having your voice heard and contributing to EU policy-making processes.

   To participate, keep an eye on the official EU Delegation to Hungary website (<https://eeas.europa.eu/delegations/hungary_en>) and local media for announcements about upcoming events. You can also register for events through the EU's "Have Your Say" platform (<https://europa.eu/european-union/eu-region/have-your-say_en>).

2. **EU-funded projects and events**: Many organizations, including schools, NGOs, and local authorities, receive EU funding to implement projects and events. These can range from educational workshops and cultural events to environmental initiatives and youth exchanges. Benefits include:
   - Gaining new skills and knowledge.
   - Meeting and collaborating with people from other EU countries.
   - Contributing to your community and making a difference.

   To participate, ask your school or local organizations if they are involved in any EU-funded projects. You can also check the EU's "Europe for Citizens" program (<https://e
Q5_59_ I am 9 years old and from Hungary. I know not at all about European Citizens’ Initiative. Can you tell me more about this? What is it? What can I do with it?

Dear friend,

I'm glad you're interested in learning about the European Citizens' Initiative (ECI)! It's a great way for citizens like you to have a say in the European Union's policies. Here's a simple explanation:

1. **What is the European Citizens' Initiative (ECI)?**
   The ECI is a tool that allows citizens of the EU to call on the European Commission to propose new laws. It's a way for your voice to be heard at the European level. The ECI was introduced in 2012 to give EU citizens a direct say in the EU's decision-making process.

2. **How does it work?**
   - To start an ECI, you need to be a citizen of an EU country and have a proposal for a new EU law or policy.
   - You need to gather support from at least one million EU citizens from at least seven different EU countries. This is called the "one million signature threshold".
   - Once you've gathered the signatures, the European Commission will examine your proposal. If it's relevant for EU law and falls within the Commission's powers, they will have to respond to your proposal.

3. **What can you do with it?**
   - **Learn about EU policies**: The ECI is a great way to learn about different EU policies and how they affect your life.
   - **Get involved**: If there's an ECI that you care about, you can support it by signing the initiative or helping to collect signatures.
   - **Start your own ECI**: When you're older, you might want to start your own ECI if you have an idea for a new EU law or policy. This can help you learn about EU politics and how to make a difference.

4. **Why is it important?**
   The ECI is important because it gives EU citizens a direct say in the EU's decision-making
