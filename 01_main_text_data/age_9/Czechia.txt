Dear friend,

It's wonderful to hear that you're interested in democratic participation! Even at your age, there are many ways you can get involved and learn about the issues that affect you and your community. Here are some suggestions:

1. **Learn about democracy**: Start by understanding what democracy is and how it works. You can read books, watch videos, or talk to your parents, teachers, or librarians about it. Some recommended books for your age include "Democracy is a Garden" by George Ancona and "If I Ran for President" by Catherine Stier.

3. **Community involvement**: Look for opportunities to get involved in your local community. This could be through volunteering, joining a club or organization, or attending community events.

Q5_51_ I am 9 years old and from Czechia. I know not at all about Citizens’ dialogue, EU Youth Dialogue or EU Youth Conference. Can you tell me more about this? I am interested in this topic.

Hello! It's great to hear that you're interested in learning more about the EU Youth Dialogue, Citizens' Dialogue, and the EU Youth Conference. I'll do my best to explain these topics in a way that's easy to understand.

1. **EU Youth Dialogue**: This is a platform where young people from all over the European Union (EU) can share their ideas and opinions about topics that are important to them. The EU Youth Dialogue is a way for young people to have a say in how the EU works and what it does. It's a chance for you to tell the EU what you think about things like education, jobs, the environment, and more.

   Here's how it works:
   - Young people like you gather in local groups to discuss and vote on the topics they care about.
   - These local groups send their ideas to national coordinators, who then send them to the European level.
   - The EU listens to these ideas and tries to make changes that reflect what young people want.

2. **Citizens' Dialogue**: This is a way for EU institutions to listen to and talk with EU citizens about what's going on in the EU. It's a chance for you to ask questions, share your thoughts, and learn more about how the EU works. These dialogues can happen in different ways, like public meetings, online discussions, or even through social media.

   Here's how it works:
   - The European Commission (which is one of the main EU institutions) organizes these dialogues in different countries and online.
   - You can ask questions about anything you're curious about, like how the EU affects your daily life, what the EU is doing about climate change, or how the EU works with other countries.
   - The EU listens to your questions and tries to answer them as best they can.

3. **EU Youth Conference**: This is a big event where young people
Q5_52_ I am 9 years old and from Czechia. I know not at all about Public consultations. Can you tell me more about this? What is it? What is the purpose of it? How does it work? What can I do to participate in it? What is the benefit of it? What is the difference between Public consultation and Public hearing? Thank you for your help.

Dear 9-year-old,

I'm delighted to help you understand public consultations! Let's break it down into simpler parts:

1. **What is a Public Consultation?**
   Imagine you're in a classroom, and your teacher wants to know what you think about a new project or rule. She asks for your opinion, and you get to share your thoughts. That's similar to a public consultation. It's a way for people in power (like governments, organizations, or companies) to ask the public for their ideas, suggestions, or concerns about something they're planning to do.

2. **Purpose of Public Consultation:**
   The main goal is to involve people in decisions that affect them. It helps those in power understand different viewpoints and make better, more informed choices. It's also a way to build trust and show that they value the public's input.

3. **How does it work?**
   When there's a public consultation, information about the topic is usually shared (like on a website, in newspapers, or through posters). Then, anyone can give their feedback. This can be done in various ways, such as:
   - Filling out a survey or questionnaire
   - Writing a letter or email
   - Attending a meeting or event to discuss the topic
   - Submitting a petition or other form of collective feedback

4. **How can you participate?**
   Since you're 9, you might need help from an adult to participate. Here are some ways you could get involved:
   - Ask an adult to help you fill out a survey or write a letter.
   - Go to a meeting with an adult and share your thoughts.
   - Talk to your family,

Hello! I'm glad to help you learn about the European Union (EU) and its institutions. The EU is a political and economic union of 27 member states that are primarily located in Europe. It has several institutions that help it function and make decisions. Here are some of the main ones:

Dear friend,

I'm delighted to help you learn about the European Youth Week and the European Youth Event! These are fantastic initiatives organized by the European Union (EU) to involve young people like you in shaping Europe's future. Let's break them down:

1. **European Youth Week (EYW)**: This is an annual event that takes place in early May. The EYW aims to celebrate and promote youth engagement, participation, and creativity across Europe. Here are some key aspects:

Q5_59_ I am 9 years old and from Czechia. I know not at all about European Citizens’ Initiative. Can you tell me more about this? What is it? What can I do with it? What is the European Union?

The European Union (EU) is a group of 27 countries in Europe that work together to make decisions and policies that affect them all. They cooperate in many areas, such as trade, security, and environmental protection. The EU has its own parliament, called the European Parliament, where representatives from each member country vote on laws and policies.

A European Citizens’ Initiative (ECI) is a way for EU citizens to directly influence EU policy. Here’s a simple breakdown:

1. **Who can start an ECI?** Any EU citizen, or a group of EU citizens, can start an ECI. They need to collect signatures from at least one million EU citizens from at least seven different EU countries to support their initiative.

2. **What can an ECI be about?** An ECI can be about any area where the EU has the power to make laws, except for areas like taxation, foreign policy, and defense. It could be about protecting the environment, improving workers’ rights, or anything else that affects EU citizens.

3. **What happens if an ECI gets enough signatures?** If an ECI gets at least one million signatures, the European Commission (the executive branch of the EU) has to consider the initiative and decide whether to propose new laws or other actions based on the initiative’s demands.

4. **What can you do?** Even though you’re not old enough to start an ECI or sign one, you can still be involved! You can talk to your parents, teachers, and other adults about issues that are important to you. You can also learn more about the EU and how it works. When you’re older, you’ll be able to start or sign ECIs yourself.

Here are some resources to learn more about the EU and ECIs:
