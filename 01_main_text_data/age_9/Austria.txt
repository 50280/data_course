2. **Reduce, Reuse, Recycle**: Practice the three R's in your daily life. Reduce waste by using reusable bags, bottles, and containers. Reuse items as much as possible, and recycle what you can't reuse.

3. **Plant Trees**: Trees absorb carbon dioxide, which helps combat climate change. You can plant trees in your backyard, a local park, or participate in a community tree-planting event.

4. **Conserve Water**: Turn off the tap while brushing your teeth or washing your hands. Fix any leaks in your home. Collect rainwater to water your plants.

5. **Save Energy**: Turn off lights and electronics when you're not using them. Use energy-efficient light bulbs. Consider using public transportation, carpooling, or riding a bike instead of driving to reduce your carbon footprint.

6. **Protect Wildlife**: Create a safe space for wildlife in your backyard by installing bird feeders, birdhouses, or bat boxes. Never litter, as it can harm or kill wildlife.

7. **Adopt, Don't Shop**: If you're thinking about getting a pet, consider adopting from a shelter instead of buying from a pet store. This helps reduce the demand for puppy mills and gives a home to an animal in need.

8. **Volunteer**: You're already thinking about this, which is great! You can volunteer at a local animal shelter, wildlife rehabilitation center, or environmental conservation organization.

Q3_32_ I am 9 years old and from Austria. I have never taken part in activities that relate to democratic participation because I did not know that I could do this. For my friends, this is a lot the same. Can you tell me more about how I can do that? I would like to do something for my city and for the environment.

Thank you for your question! It's great that you're interested in getting involved in your community and making a difference. Here are some ways you can participate in democratic processes and contribute to your city and the environment:

1. **Join a Youth Council or Youth Parliament**: These are groups where young people can voice their opinions and ideas about local issues. They often work with local governments to make decisions that affect young people. Check if your city has one, and if not, you could start one!

2. **Participate in Local Elections**: While you might not be old enough to vote yet, you can still participate in elections by helping with campaigns, observing the process, or even running for a youth council position if there's one in your city.

3. **Start a School or Community Project**: You could start a project focused on environmental issues, such as a recycling program, a community garden, or a campaign to reduce waste. You could also start a project focused on social issues, like bullying prevention or mental health awareness.

4. **Write Letters or Petitions**: You can write letters to your local representatives about issues you care about, or start a petition to gather support for a cause. Websites like Change.org make it easy to start petitions.

5. **Attend Community Meetings or Town Halls**: These are public meetings where local issues are discussed. You can attend these meetings to learn about what's happening in your community and share your thoughts.

6. **Volunteer**: Volunteering is a great way to get involved in your community. You could volunteer at a local environmental organization, a community center, or a charity.

7. **Educate Others**: You can organize workshops or presentations at your school or in your community to educate others about issues you care about. This could be about environmental issues, social justice, or anything else that's important to you.

   - European Youth Portal: https://europa.eu/youth/portal_en

3. **Social Media**: Many politicians and organizations have social media accounts where they engage with their followers. You can use these platforms to ask questions, share your opinions, or learn more about what's happening in your community and beyond.

4. **School Activities**: Your school might have clubs or groups that focus on social issues, politics, or current events. Joining these can be a great way to learn and participate in democratic processes.

6. **Online Petitions**: Websites like Change.org allow you to start or sign petitions on issues you care about. This is a way to show your support for a cause and make your voice heard.

Q5_51_ I am 9 years old and from Austria. I know not at all about Citizens’ dialogue, EU Youth Dialogue or EU Youth Conference. Can you tell me more about this? I am very interested in this topic.

Dear friend,

I'm delighted to hear about your interest in the EU Youth Dialogue and Citizens' Dialogue! Let's break down these topics into simpler parts to help you understand them better.

1. **EU (European Union)**: The EU is a group of 27 countries in Europe that work together to make decisions about many aspects of life, like trade, travel, and environmental protection. This helps to make life easier and more fair for people living in these countries.

2. **Citizens' Dialogue**: Imagine you're having a conversation with your friends about something important, like how to make your school a better place. You all share your ideas, listen to each other, and try to find solutions together. A Citizens' Dialogue is similar, but on a larger scale. It's a conversation between EU citizens and EU leaders about important topics that affect our daily lives. These dialogues help EU leaders understand what people think and need, and they give citizens a chance to have their say. They can happen in many ways, like public meetings, online discussions, or surveys.

3. **EU Youth Dialogue**: The EU Youth Dialogue is a special part of the Citizens' Dialogue, focused on young people like you. It's a way for the EU to listen to and involve young people in decisions that affect their lives. Here's how it works:

   - **EU Youth Conference**: Every year, the EU brings together young people from all over Europe to talk about a specific topic, like education, jobs, or climate change. These meetings are called EU Youth Conferences. Young people share their ideas, experiences, and suggestions with each other and with EU leaders.

   - **EU Youth Dialogue events**: Throughout the year, there are also smaller events and activities in different countries. These give young people more chances to share their thoughts and ideas with each other and with EU leaders.

   - **EU Youth Goals**: Based

Q5_53_ I am 9 years old and from Austria. I know kind of about European elections. Can you tell me more about this? What are they and how do they work?

Dear 9-year-old,

I'm delighted to help you understand the European elections! Let's break it down into simpler parts:

1. **What are the European elections?**
   Imagine you have a big school, and you want to choose some representatives to help make decisions for the whole school. These representatives will be part of a council that discusses and votes on important rules for the school. The European elections are like that, but for a much bigger group of people, called the European Union (EU). The EU is like a big club of countries that work together. Right now, there are 27 countries in this club, including Austria.

2. **Who can vote?**
   In the European elections, people from the EU countries can vote. This means that even though you're from Austria, you can vote for the European Parliament when you're 18 years old. Some countries also allow non-EU citizens who live there to vote, but this depends on the rules of each country.

3. **What do we vote for?**
   When you vote in the European elections, you're choosing who will represent your country in the European Parliament. The European Parliament is like the school council I mentioned earlier. It's made up of Members of the European Parliament (MEPs), who are elected by the people in each EU country.

4. **How does the voting work?**
   The voting system can vary a bit from country to country, but here's a simple explanation:

   - **Direct election**: In some countries, people vote directly for their preferred candidate or party. The candidates with the most votes win a seat in the European Parliament.

   - **Closed list system**: In other countries, people vote for a political party, and the party decides who will be the MEPs. The candidates on the party list are chosen based on how many votes the party gets.

5. **What does the European Parliament do
Q5_54_ I am 9 years old and from Austria. I know a little about EU social media channels and websites (i.e. European Youth Portal). Can you tell me more about this? I would like to know more about the EU and how it works.

Dear friend,

It's wonderful to hear that you're interested in learning more about the European Union (EU) and its social media channels and websites! The EU has several platforms designed to engage with young people like you, helping you understand how the EU works and how you can participate in its democratic processes. Here are some key platforms and resources:

1. **European Youth Portal (https://europa.eu/youth/)**
   - The European Youth Portal is a one-stop shop for information on EU opportunities for young people. It provides details about study, work, volunteer, and training opportunities, as well as news and events related to youth in the EU.
   - You can find information on EU policies and initiatives related to youth, such as the European Youth Strategy and the Erasmus+ program.
   - The portal is available in all official EU languages, including German.

2. **EU40 (https://www.eu40.org/)**
   - EU40 is a network of young professionals working in EU institutions, national representations, and other EU-related organizations. They aim to connect young people with the EU and foster a better understanding of its workings.
   - EU40 organizes events, workshops, and webinars on various EU-related topics. While some events may be targeted at young professionals, others are open to anyone interested in learning more about the EU.

3. **EU Social Media Channels**
   - The EU has official social media accounts on platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube, providing updates on EU news, policies, and initiatives in a more interactive and engaging format.
   - Here are some official EU accounts you might find interesting:
     - Facebook: @EUinAustria, @EUEuropeanCommission, @EUCouncil, @EUCouncilPresidency

Q5_55_ I am 9 years old and from Austria. I know not at all about Visit of the EU institutions. Can you tell me more about this? Thank you.

The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of 27 member states that are primarily located in Europe. The EU has several institutions that help it function and make decisions. Here are some of the main EU institutions and their roles:

1. **European Parliament**: This is the only directly elected EU institution. It represents the people of Europe and has the power to pass laws and approve the EU's budget. It's based in Strasbourg, France, but also has offices in Brussels, Belgium, and Luxembourg.

2. **Council of the European Union**: This is where national ministers from each EU country meet to discuss and decide on EU policies. The Council is based in Brussels, and the presidency of the Council rotates among the member states every six months.

3. **European Commission**: This is the executive body of the EU. It proposes new laws, manages the day-to-day business of the EU, and makes sure that EU laws are enforced. The Commission is based in Brussels and is led by a President and several Commissioners.

4. **European Council**: This is where the heads of state or government of the EU member states, along with the President of the European Commission and the President of the European Council, meet to set the EU's political agenda and provide the necessary impetus for its development. The European Council meets in Brussels.

5. **European Court of Justice**: This is the highest court in the EU. It makes sure that EU law is interpreted and applied correctly. It's based in Luxembourg.

Q5_57_ I am 9 years old and from Austria. I know not at all about Contacting a Commissioner or an MEP. Can you tell me more about this? I would like to write to them about the climate crisis.

Dear 9-year-old,

It's wonderful to hear that you're already thinking about the climate crisis and wanting to make a difference. You're never too young to start advocating for the issues you care about. Here's a simple guide on how to contact a Commissioner or a Member of the European Parliament (MEP):

1. **European Commissioners:**
   The European Commission is the executive branch of the European Union (EU), responsible for proposing and enforcing legislation. Each Commissioner is responsible for a specific policy area.

   - **Find the right Commissioner:** The Commissioner responsible for climate action is currently Frans Timmermans. You can find more information about him and his work on the European Commission's website: https://ec.europa.eu/commission/commissioners/2019-2024/timmermans_en

   - **Write a letter:** You can write a letter to Commissioner Timmermans expressing your concerns about the climate crisis. Here's a simple format you can follow:
     - Start with a greeting (e.g., "Dear Commissioner Timmermans,")
     - Introduce yourself and explain why you're writing (e.g., "I am a 9-year-old from Austria who is very worried about the climate crisis.")

Q5_59_ I am 9 years old and from Austria. I know a little about European Citizens’ Initiative. Can you tell me more about this? What is it and how does it work?

Dear friend,

I'm delighted to help you understand the European Citizens’ Initiative (ECI) in a simple and fun way!

Imagine you have a great idea that you think could make Europe a better place. The ECI is like a big suggestion box where you and other Europeans can put forward your ideas for changes in European Union (EU) policies. If enough people support your idea, the European Commission, which is like the government of the EU, has to consider it seriously.

Here's how it works:

1. **Collecting signatures**: To start an ECI, you need to collect at least one million signatures from at least seven different EU countries within one year. This shows that many people across Europe support your idea. You can collect signatures online or on paper.

2. **Checking signatures**: Once you've collected the signatures, they need to be checked to make sure they're all valid. This is done by the national authorities in each country.

3. **Presenting the ECI**: After the signatures have been checked, your ECI is presented to the European Commission. They have three months to decide what to do with your proposal. They can either:

   - **Take action**: If they think your idea is good, they might start working on it right away.
   - **Give a reason**: If they don't want to take action, they have to explain why not.
   - **Ask for more information**: Sometimes, they might need more details or clarification before they can decide what to do.

4. **One ECI per year**: If your ECI is successful, you can only start another one after a year has passed.

The ECI is a great way for citizens like you to have a say in how the EU works. It's important to remember that the EU is made up of many different countries, so it's always trying to find solutions that work for everyone.

Keep up your interest in European
