Q3_30_ I am 9 years old and from Denmark. I have never taken part in activities that relate to democratic participation because I don’t understand the issues enough. For my friends, this is not at all the same. Can you tell me more about how I can do that? I would like to be able to participate in the democratic process.

Dear friend,

It's wonderful to hear that you're interested in participating in the democratic process! At your age, there are many ways you can start to engage and learn about democracy. Here are some suggestions:

1. **Learn about democracy**: Start by understanding what democracy is and how it works. You can read books, watch videos, or talk to your parents, teachers, or other adults about it. Some recommended books for your age include "Democracy is a Garden" by George Ancona and "If I Ran for President" by Catherine Stier.

2. **School activities**: Participate in school activities that involve decision-making and voting. This could be anything from choosing a class representative to deciding on a school event. These experiences can help you understand how voting and representation work in a democratic system.

This could be helping with a community clean-up, participating in a local event, or even starting your own small project to improve your neighborhood. These experiences can help you understand local governance and how your actions can make a difference.

5. **Youth councils and parliaments**: Check if there are any youth councils or parliaments in your area. These are great places for young people to learn about democracy and have a say in local decision-making. If there aren't any, you could even start your own!

Dear friend,

It's wonderful to hear that you're interested in democratic participation at such a young age! There are many ways you can get involved and make a difference, even if you're not able to attend physical events due to distance or transportation issues. Here are some suggestions:

Dear young friend,

I'm delighted to hear about your interest in the EU Youth Dialogue and Citizens' Dialogues! These initiatives are fantastic opportunities for young people like you to have a say in shaping the future of Europe. Let's break down each of these concepts for you:

1. **EU Youth Dialogue**: This is a platform created by the European Commission to give young people a voice in EU policy-making. It's a great way for you to share your ideas, concerns, and suggestions about issues that matter to you and your peers. Here's how it works:

   - **EU Youth Conferences**: These are events where young people from all over Europe come together to discuss and vote on topics that are important to them. The results of these conferences are then presented to EU decision-makers.

   - **EU Youth Dialogue Online**: This is an online platform where you can participate in discussions, share your ideas, and vote on topics even if you can't attend a conference in person.

   - **EU Youth Goals**: These are a set of eight goals that young people have identified as priorities for the future of Europe. They cover topics like education, employment, participation, and more. You can find out more about these goals and how to contribute to them on the EU Youth Dialogue website.

2. **Citizens' Dialogues**: These are public events organized by the European Commission and its representations in EU Member States. They provide a space for open and informal discussions between EU officials and citizens, including young people like you. The aim is to listen to your views and ideas, and to explain how the EU works and how it affects your daily life. Topics can vary, but they often include issues like the environment, the economy, or the future of Europe.

To participate in these initiatives, you can:

- Keep an eye on the EU Youth Dialogue website for upcoming events and online discussions.
- Check the European Commission's events

Q5_54_ I am 9 years old and from Denmark. I know not at all about EU social media channels and websites (i.e. European Youth Portal). Can you tell me more about this? I am interested in learning more about the EU and how it works.

Hello! It's great to hear that you're interested in learning more about the EU. The European Union (EU) has several social media channels and websites that can help you understand how it works and engage with other young people across Europe. Here are some of them:

1. **European Youth Portal (https://europa.eu/youth/)**
   - The European Youth Portal is a one-stop-shop for information on learning and training opportunities, jobs, volunteering, and youth activities across Europe.
   - You can find information about EU programs like Erasmus+, which allows young people to study, work, or volunteer abroad.
   - The portal also provides news and articles about youth-related topics and EU policies.

2. **EU40 (https://www.eu40.org/)**
   - EU40 is a network of young professionals working in the EU institutions, national governments, and other EU-related organizations.
   - They organize events and workshops to discuss EU policies and engage with young people.

Q5_55_ I am 9 years old and from Denmark. I know not at all about Visit of the EU institutions. Can you tell me more about this? I am very interested in the EU and the EU institutions.

Hello! It's great to hear that you're interested in the European Union (EU) and its institutions. I'd be happy to explain them in a way that's easy to understand.

1. **What is the European Union (EU)?**
The EU is like a big club of 27 countries in Europe. They work together to make rules that help them trade with each other, travel freely, and cooperate on many other things. This makes it easier for people, goods, and services to move around Europe.

2. **EU Institutions:**
These are like the different parts of a government that help the EU make decisions and work together. Here are the main ones:

   - **European Parliament:** This is like the parliament in your country. It's made up of members who are elected by the people of the EU countries. They make laws and decide how EU money is spent. They also have the power to approve or reject the Commission's work.

   - **European Commission:** Imagine this as the EU's government. It's led by a President and has Commissioners who are in charge of different areas like economy, environment, or foreign affairs. They propose new laws and make sure EU countries follow the rules.

   - **Council of the European Union:** This is where representatives from each EU country meet to make decisions. They can be ministers or other government officials. The Council can make laws and decide on policies.

   - **European Council:** This is a bit different. It's made up of the heads of state or government of each EU country, plus the President of the Commission and the President of the European Parliament. They meet regularly to give guidance on the EU's future direction.

   - **European Court of Justice:** This is the EU's highest court. It makes sure that EU law is followed correctly and solves disputes between EU countries, EU institutions, or people and companies.

Q5_56_ I am 9 years old and from Denmark. I know  about The European Youth Week or the European Youth Event. Can you tell me more about this? What is it and how can I participate?

The European Youth Week and the European Youth Event (EYE) are initiatives organized by the European Union to engage young people in the democratic process and to give them a voice in shaping the future of Europe. Here's a bit more information about each:

1. **European Youth Week (EYW)**: This is an annual event that takes place in early May. It's a decentralized event, meaning that it's organized locally in different European countries by various organizations, schools, and youth councils. The goal is to raise awareness about the importance of youth participation in society and to encourage young people to get involved in their communities.

   - **How to participate**: Check if there are any local events happening in your area during the European Youth Week. You can look for information on your local municipality's website, schools, or youth organizations. If there are no events planned, you could even start your own! It could be a small gathering to discuss local issues, a workshop, or a community service activity.

2. **European Youth Event (EYE)**: This is a larger, more structured event that takes place every two years in the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France. It brings together thousands of young people from all over Europe to discuss and debate on various topics related to the EU's policies and priorities. The event includes workshops, debates, and cultural activities.

Q5_57_ I am 9 years old and from Denmark. I know a lot about Contacting a Commissioner or an MEP. Can you tell me more about this? I want to know more about the European Union and how it works.

Dear 9-year-old,

It's fantastic to hear that you're interested in learning about the European Union (EU) and how it works! I'm here to help you understand it in a simple and fun way.

1. **What is the European Union?**
The European Union is like a big club of 27 countries in Europe. They work together to make rules that help them trade, travel, and cooperate with each other. This makes it easier for people, goods, and services to move around Europe.

2. **Who makes the rules?**
The EU has several institutions that help make decisions and create rules. Here are two important ones:

   - **The European Commission**: Imagine the Commission as the EU's government. They propose new laws and make sure that EU countries follow the rules. The Commission has 27 Commissioners, one from each EU country. They are chosen by the governments of the member states and must be approved by the European Parliament.

   - **The European Parliament**: This is like the EU's parliament. It has 705 Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) who are elected by EU citizens every 5 years. MEPs make laws together with the Council of the EU (which represents the governments of the member states).

3. **Contacting a Commissioner or an MEP**:
If you have ideas, questions, or concerns about the EU, you can contact a Commissioner or an MEP. They are there to listen to EU citizens and represent their interests. Here's how you can do it:

   - **Contacting a Commissioner**: You can write a letter or send an email to the European Commission's public inquiries service. They will forward your message to the relevant Commissioner. You can also write directly to a Commissioner's office, but make sure to include your name, address, and date of birth so they can reply to you.

Q5_58_ I am 9 years old and from Denmark. I know  about Participation in events organised by the EU in your country. Can you tell me more about this? I am very interested in this.

Dear friend,

It's wonderful to hear about your interest in the European Union (EU) and its events! The EU organizes various events and initiatives that allow young people like you to participate, learn, and express your opinions. Here are a few examples:

1. **EU Youth Dialogue**: This is an ongoing process that gives young people the opportunity to express their ideas and expectations on various topics, such as education, employment, and participation in society. The EU listens to these ideas and uses them to shape its policies. You can participate by joining local or national discussions, or by contributing online.

2. **European Youth Event (EYE)**: This is a large-scale event organized by the European Parliament every two years in Strasbourg, France. It brings together thousands of young people from all over Europe to discuss and debate on various topics, meet with EU decision-makers, and participate in workshops, debates, and cultural activities. The next EYE is planned for May 2023.

3. **EU Youth Conferences**: These are smaller events organized by the EU in different member countries. They focus on specific themes and provide a platform for young people to share their ideas and experiences. You can check if there are any upcoming conferences in Denmark or online.

4. **Erasmus+**: This is the EU's program for education, training, youth, and sport. It offers opportunities for young people to study, train, or volunteer abroad, as well as to participate in youth exchanges and other activities. You might not be eligible yet, but it's good to know about it for the future.

5. **Local and national events**: Many EU-funded projects and initiatives are implemented at the local and national levels. These can include workshops, seminars, and competitions. Keep an eye out for these in your school, community, or online.

To stay updated about these events and opportunities, you can:

Q5_59_ I am 9 years old and from Denmark. I know kind of about European Citizens’ Initiative. Can you tell me more about this? What is it and how does it work?

Dear 9-year-old,

I'm delighted to help you understand the European Citizens’ Initiative (ECI) in a simple way!

Imagine you have an idea that you think could make Europe a better place. The ECI is like a way for you to share this idea with the European Commission, which is like the government of the European Union (EU). The EU has 27 countries, and the European Commission helps make sure they all work together.

Here's how the ECI works:

1. **Come up with an idea**: You or a group of people (at least 7 citizens from at least 7 different EU countries) think of a good idea for Europe. This could be about the environment, health, digital rights, or anything else that affects all Europeans.

2. **Gather support**: To show that your idea is important to many people, you need to collect signatures. At least 1 million people from at least 7 different EU countries need to sign your proposal within 1 year. You can collect signatures online or on paper.

3. **Check the signatures**: The European Commission checks if your proposal has enough signatures and comes from enough different countries. If it does, they will look into your idea and decide if they can do something about it.

4. **The European Commission responds**: If your idea is something the European Commission can work on, they will tell you how they plan to respond. They might start a new law, change an existing one, or do something else to help make your idea a reality.

5. **The European Parliament and Council decide**: If the European Commission likes your idea, they will suggest it to the European Parliament and Council. These are the two other main parts of the EU, and they decide together if they want to make your idea into a new law or change an existing one.

So, the ECI is like a way for European citizens to tell the EU what
